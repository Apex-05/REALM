no get that, but its still not someone whos representati've of the average american. he has been afforded opportunities most of us don't even think to dream of. and theres nothing wrong with that, but as leader of country id prefer someone whos at some point had to do the grind and didn't have safety net to fall on and got there on their own. wishful thinking, know.

the power to admit new states or to change state boundaries is already outlined in article iv, section clause of the constitution. in short, and for the purposes of how it relates to this discussion, there can't be any top-down redrawing of state lines like you're advocating for. such boundary changes must be agreed upon locally by the state legislatures themselves and then approved by congress. so go on and talk to people in either of the dakotas, to use your example, and belittlingly explain to them how they are basically the same state and are wasting electoral resources, and that they really should go on and merge for the benefit of everybody else.

my best run is with vlad. have been trying to do an hparmor run with beefy rings to see what the scaling is like. had rings with hp, maybe or syringes, and shrine dmg upgrade and ended with before using juice boost .x dmg. think if replaced the armor with dmg wouldve lasted longer. was surviving swarmed hits all the way up to and then got one shot cry

not really, its like umpires call in cricket, where theres certain grey area where whatever the umpire decides on the ground is the decision that we go ahead with. outside of that grey area, the technology gets to decide the final decision. works pretty well in that sport, at least... yeah, some people moan about it when decision doesn't go their way, but most people usually shrug and get on with it.

scientifically seen, it should be started as soon as possible below age since the medication is approved for that age. but yes that up to age window is the best though it works very well in all ages. its about the gaba switch and as you know that happens very early so trying to modulate that should also happen very early.

this is exactly the result of the failure of patriarchy to adequately run the show. patriarchy failed miserably. never said it would be pretty. don't be angry at me for acknowledging the reality of it. be mad at the system that has destroyed so much. patriarchy has never been pretty. it has always been violent, and horrific, unjust, destructi've, and rape filled. if there is chance to save anything going forward, it will not be saved by patriarchal rule. if you want to quake and cry while others try to save what remains, you go on and cry then. it is tragic. be in your feelings. patriarchy was always going to fail miserably, and here we are. the best we can do is save what we can, and mini'mize suffering as we are able, and to plan for something better so these failures are not repeated.
