yeah. but its complicated. the army leadership were all members of the islamic brotherhood. however, they are not ideologically committed. now there is broad coalition supporting the army. from islamists to communists to liberals to everyday people. the overwhelming majority of people support the army. partially because of how the rsf behave in cities they control.

why would space aliens suddenly invalidate religions? theyve been incorporating and changing their beliefs for centuries, its not hard to i'magine them saying god also created these aliens and weve gotta tell them about jesus. it really wouldnt be big deal to people that already gobble up lies and ask for seconds.

i've been there, manual checks start to feel like full-ti'me job after while. one thing that sped things up for me was sorting emails by domain first and running bulk checks grouped by company instead of random batches. catch-all filters usually repeat by domain, so you can skip hundreds once you figure out how that companys setup behaves. also built quick google sheets script that pings validation apis overnight so everythings ready by morning. if you ever need cleaner starting data, i've seen companies like techsalerator or clearbit offer lists that are already verified which helps skip most of the grunt work.

i've just had hard ti'me getting into some books on second read. tried to reread lord of the rings, but after few hours it just didn't sink its hook into me like it did the first ti'me. same thing with ursula leguins the dispossessed. also didn't find maughams the razors edge as interesting and enlightening on the second read. someti'mes on these rereads something just feels flat, and have to labor to continue on in ways that didn't on the first read.

saw atmosphere but didn't you have it with picture sleeve? it was factory single anyway. i'm trying to buy the different colours of procession but stuck with three theres to much money and even if love all artwork its always something else that is more i'mportant. but buy duplicates- or triplicates of some singles same pressings. have you posted any lps?

pull from pen, just putting the dexcom needle into the insulin chamber. there is no need to dial anything on the pen. i'm just basically using it li've vial, getting pods worth per pen. the trick is to draw slowly. the needle is small so it won't fill quickly but its an airtight seal, so it will eventually fill.

absolutely agree with you my brother. which is my gripe with glock. with all the latest developments of frts for absolutely every platform, banning things that are readily convertible will become the norm. they broke see pressure and now that same pressure will be applied to gun manufacturers everywhere. they found their loophole, and you best believe its not gonna stop there. they want to cater to commiefornia, then choose to take my business elsewhere. again, all of this is just personal opinion and i'm not out here saying that if your supporting glock, your ignorant. this is me and my call. just not something can get behind. they already had bans in place for what models you could and couldnt own. so it would make more sense to stop selling to ca altogether, until someone brought forth lawsuit to unravel everything and then pick up where you left off. preface this with do not care about glock switches and all that other crap. its the principle.

iny experience felt that the earlier chapters were the best and made me feel like the manwha was but as the story got closer towards the end it started becoming more cliche and generic and the romantic ships never sailed either. the ending was literally all the strong people teaming up to defeat mega villian marvel type shit in just one try which honestly felt so underwhelming considering the hype and buildup around the wrong building and the character deaths.

if you are cool with using computer you can get an edrumin from audiofront, lemon pro without module from alibaba for around depending what all you get. the edrumin is designed to play with drum software pri'marily and is good way to get really good performance out of kit for cheaper than buying into the roland ecosystem. to get really good latency on windows suggest focusrite th gen audio interfaces as those fit you an affordable very low latency experience using good asio dri'ver. if you have mac that deli'vers that without any additional stuff.
