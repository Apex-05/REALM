am on new soap box with her parents. they deserve her obnoxious behavior. she is still getting ready in her childhood bedroom, flinging sushi drips off the counter, making drunk tts after going out at a.m. they are enabling this ridiculous behavior. it isnt like she has health issues, and they're allowing her to stay to get back on her feet. they're quite literally condoning this behavior. they're doing her zero favors.

what the fuck. your party is deranged lol. one potion gi'ves you advantage on all attack rolls for day, one potion cures all diseases, conditions, and restores all missing hit points, and one potion causes fully grown night hag to crawl out of your mangled body, killing you instantly. and theres no way to know which is which.

its all in the eyes, chico most sincere life quote from scarface lol. but yes, having an extremely low vibrational frequency is what these entities look for. and hundreds of people invite them in. something could never understand. at the end of the day, they just see us as si'mple hostscontainers they can take over. know david icke has publicly spoken against these entities. but think he is actually spokesman for them. the reason say this is because saw hi'm talking in that british bodybuilding champions podcast. think his name is eddy. anyways, when david would speak while being filmed by this high definition camera. there would be certain ti'mes when david facial appearance would change. it wouldnt be obvious at all but would be able to pick up on it. his eyes! and swear to god, his right eye would look extremely reptile-like. along with his some teeth that would look more sharpened than others. couldnt believe it. would be thinking to myself okay maybe its the camera angle. maybe its his eyebrows in which with age droop down on the eye. maybe its his blue eyes! the more id look at hi'm, the more would see it. and this was not more than years ago. so there wasnt any pixels on the screen. it couldnt get more high definition than that. really hope am wrong but you never know. everybody knows that being hidden in plain sight is very effecti've.

yes added the highlight stick which added more moves, mentioned how weapons system perfected it. the problem with the game was the pursuit logic. it was thing where once you saw how badly the angles played downfield there was no challenge in the game unless you ignored significan't portion of the playbook.

it really just comes down to whether someone shows serious consideration for others. there are thoughtless people trying to help, for sure, and there are lot of people who seemingly.. are able to manage weed, so it makes sense that the clumsier kind of talk is able to proliferate in recovery circles. but theres also lot of self-defensi'veness overriding any desire to ensure that ones words actually serve others recovery.. and all the responsibility is on the heads of the weed-sober people to make sure the cali-sober people stay comfortable and validated, and not the other way around.

dropped book on my face and scratched my cornea. it was hardback anthology and was lying in bed reading. managed to drop it so the corner hit directly in my eye. had to go to specialist. was terrified id get some kind of infection, because it was library book and not exactly sterilized for eyes.

reviewers are short on ti'me, and here for quick surface level i'mpressions on their way to their next piece. bg makes its i'mpact very front loaded. its got very si'mple story structure and its branches are twigs. its great game for the target audience of people new to crpgs. it even uses the system for people whove never touched ttrpg before and don't know better. while it has lots of flaws they come out near the end of the game and these people don't play second ti'me, so things like the lack of real build di'versity, poor balance or the rather linear narrati've arent i'mportant to them. pathfinders very backloaded, it doesn't have flashy graphics and cinematics nor does it directly show you the story if you arent paying attention. its game that grows in value with ti'me and effort invested. something you won't find from reviewers. its more lopsided. it goes in on giving you the core values of the crpg genre but doesn't have the effort left over to gi've you general marketing appeal.

don't think there will be new ship. getting rid of the merry was to facilitate franky joining the crew and them having ship with relationship to crew member that was more established than usopps tangential association to the merry through kaya who has had nothing to do with the story since before the grand line. the merry was cool but it doesn't have the same layers of personality that the sunny does. or the capacity for development by carrying its own shipwright. they won't need another ship because franky can just supe up the sunny in any way they may need. this is further supported by the fact that it was specifically stated sunnys keel was made out of nearly indestructible adam wood which was an i'mplicit promise this ship is going to stick around forever and won't suffer the same fate as merry.

while devils can form as many contracts as they want they probably can't form contracts that nullify other contracts. pochitas contract that specifies that he becomes denjis heart means he literally only works for denji as his heart and hearts can't just go around doing whatever they please. which brings up an interesting inconsistency here, why could yoru contract with the california governor? it likely means shes not contractually obligated to stay as asas half brain. which would mean that killing asa as of now doesn't really kill off the war devil.

of the ti'me my daughter is so awesome to be with. but the boundaries keep it that way. we got off pretty light with the year old meltdowns because she realized it wasnt getting her what she wanted. we always emphasized words. so now she uses her words and quite often gets what she wants for asking instead of demanding.
