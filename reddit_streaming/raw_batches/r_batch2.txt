assassin just straight up wins most encounters though. if you are able to ambush successfully assassin will almost always be stronger, if not thief is stronger. just get bored of it even if am mostly ambushing. its honestly pretty funny how much full rogue with the right support breaks the game. spent most of act never even entering combat, just killing everything with gi reliable talent repositioning enemies. even in act every fight was decided by my assassin using an invis pot double critting to start fights and kill the most dangerous npc. like, other classes subclasses are better in sustained fights. but assassin rogue makes it so you have way fewer sustained fights.

few good points. but even if it isnt personal it still is vile. and don't think his line of reasoning applies to heightism at all. after all men celebrate heightist views in their circles as well. so maybe what this dude is saying just means we see more of such content online, but definitely doesn't mean its not personal in the case of short men mockery.
