the obvious chess boards. there are expensi've chess sets to take your money. and noobs will already know its game. or li've action chess with rented celebrities. the kings are kings, the bishops are bishops, etc. if their enormous fees go to charity, some might say yes. remember celebrities already do ad work. asul commission designer gemstones for piece replacements. crokinole there are some expensi've wood varieties, even before any work is done. also, custom detailed inlay work might make it onto art magazine covers. full scale li've action mechs with nerfed weapons. like bullets, etc. already thing. gotta collect them all.

tried to keep playing the game. just few hours most of my issues dissapeared, but others more reasonable arri'ved. in the end, my conclusion that the game isnt great stays, though for different reasons. the plataforming is non-existant or, when its there, its just boring. the enemies are boring, regardless of how easy or hard they're, they all feel really si'milar. theres an excess of backtracking, mostly because the game refuses to tell you where to go because fuck you guess. this adds absolutely unecessary ti'me to the game and isnt fun to do there isnt that much to explore in each area and, as stated, the enemies are boring as hell. you either figure out where to go or read guide, which shouldnt be necessary for the main plot. the story beats are sooooo bland at least at the start. was interested when started playing it, but of it its the game trying to make his sister likable it fails, don't care about her at all, or the protagonist being very edgy after giving some phylosophical speech about some subject. don't mind gore or nude in games, but nine souls has it just because it wants to shock the player and not in smart way. dropped the game after the second boss fight. the boss had cool design and and interesting premise, but the devs fucked up it up completely you just fight her two minions and wait for her to come revi've them. really? that's it? extremely easy and boring. remember when said the enemies are boring regardless of being easy or hard? that's an example. and in the end the protagonist the protagonist uses her mind controlling colar on her, instead of just killing her, because...? well idk, hes an asshole guess ?. that's funny because just few hours ago he saved that human villagers from being captured. his morals are all over the place and only appears when the devs think its worth it. that's dumb. its one of those games that feel are mediocre at best. not bad, just mediocre. and completely disagree with all the hype and good reviews it has.

actually, nasabi ko na po sa police kaso wala pa din po action nagagawa regarding dun sa pag aano nila ng boyfriend niya, inoobserve palang po. pwede ko naman raw po kasuhan sa pananakit kaso hindi po kasi kami nakapag pa-medico legal. disappointed yung dad naman po nung dalawa yung isa pamilyadong tao, yung isa hindi din financially stable pero sa pagkakaalam ko nagpapadala naman pero hindi enough pero palaging sinasabi ni mom namin hindi daw nagbibigay.

i'm in the same boat as you, see myself thinking the same way. then my mental problems start to come again and don't even realize this isnt normal. yet when explain it to someone else it isnt big deal to me and say its all in my head. try not to push these things off, it isnt healthy from my experience.
