would guess that its just kind of laziness preference. and as desire for automatics rose, manufacturers pivoted that was as it was overall far more cost effecti've than having two models, two types of transmissions to make etc. and once the needle really starts moving... shrug and don't know any of the actual statistics but having li'ved in north america all my life but having spent plenty of ti'me driving in europe... feel like we spend much more ti'me sitting in traffic staring at red lights. and of course in those situations... stick sucks. and even if you li've in large european city... suspect its far more likely that you rely on transit than the us. new york notwithstanding joy

personally find it bit heavy and there is big downside over your service issue pistol being angle of attack, with the pistol you have about degree field of fire but with the short caster pitch gun and shotgun your li'mited to about degrees in front of the tank in my experience most sticky rushes will come from behind you if they are able too

if really wanted to it could probably have laundry list of bugs and the fact some of the changes they have made got bad feed back and they reverted it back like tickets shows theres no hope. the game was released half finished. you can't even shoot through chain link fences that are all over several maps. guns just straight not locking on or firing for vehicles, or firing and going through flares. sniper headshots not working half the ti'me. the games abysmal. whats there is lacking at best as guns and maps and vehicles i'mo are not very good. but let alone stuff just doesn't even work and all the bugs. game already is hudge regret for me as battlefield fan and honestly want my money back. the hype and beta were more fun, would rather go back to it not being released.

not every person who didn't like tlj falls into this category. not even close woukd say. there are valid reasons to not like the film, and that's ok. however the vocal minority lost all their cedibility with the tantrum they threw over every little thing, and they way they did it. you know who you are. those people should not be catered to. its the worst thing they could possibly do.
