nu formule kijken en jointjes roken en chips eten. ik ben morgen ook vrij, dus ik kan het laat maken verder wel leuk weekend. vrijdag had ik mijn moeder uitgenodigd om te gaan lunchen. gisteren niet veel gedaan. eigenlijk alleen maar gamen battlefield vandaag had ik uitgeslapen tot u. toen wat huishoudelijke dingen gedaan.

id personally take the cop to small clai'ms court if you actually have all that evidence. sue hi'm for your wasted ti'me taking off work, commuting to the court, etc. its only like to file clai'm, which youd just tack onto your lawsuit. you don't need lawyer for small clai'ms, so id be petty and do it for wasting my ti'me.

did you see this person put all the papers there? did they leave them? what if the person in that seat before then left all those papers? i'm not going to judge someone for not doing anything wrong. if he cleans up the area before he leaves no harm no foul. i'm not convinced its even his paper, could be the person behind hi'm.

thank you for such an informati've reply! ill definitely have to take notes on some of the recipe stuff you wrote. in terms of purely ti'me, how long would you esti'mate each portion takes every week grocery shopping, prepping ingredients, cooking, washing dishes, storing the food? i'm actually surprised that none of your family makes what you eat because many of my friends and family usually eat home cooked stuff that family member makes idk if this is an asian thing or not. actually used to eat my dads cooking which didn't like, so he ended up not cooking anymore as much. its really refreshing to hear that it doesn't always have to be communal activity.

lol yes work remotely salary but not bonus more like depending on how well company does and was recently laid off few weeks ago so currently unemployed and husband is currently in government shit down works for the feds so he is not getting paid since october so yeah. that's fun. no income for either of us he was also wfh for the past decade until they hauled everyone back in office this year which makes zero sense for the type of work he does. smh.

love eyesight have liberty legacy outside of australia eyesight has been fantastic. it has helped me countless ti'mes. today am picking up another subaru forester touring. the legacy is going to be my sons first car. all the safety features gi've me assurance for hi'm. in fact on the weekend he just did defensi've driving course in the legacy. he had to disable the eyesight traction control and lan departure systems for the track and skid pan driving. he told me even with those off the car was so stable. the instructor commented how well the subaru handles in emergency braking, high speed turns some small under steering. have no concerns with the eyesight or cvt. you just need to be servicing the subarus on ti'me.

when played bg with the first ti'me had something like other friends playing it and swear to god when talked them about it, it seemed like we were playing different games, still can't beli've that this game was possible to make. hands down my game of the decade for now
