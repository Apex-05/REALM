compounding pharmacies...you can get tirzepatide e.g. zepbound from doctor. its not illegal, at least in the us to take peptides, but no major pharma will provide it to doctors because retatrutide is still in clinical trials and hasnt passed fda. so you have to go to compounding pharamacies to get it, who only sell it for research purposes. it is illegal for them to say it is for human use. there are pros and cons to the research only places, the biggest con is that you have less oversight into what you are actually getting and quality of it. woman, think it was called the hellfinger protocol, did like near page document on reta that is pretty easy to understand.

honestly, this looks great. lot of people will suggest leaning quickly into the science, but would say that you're on the right track and little experi'mentation will get you there. remember, this coffee will be better than you might be used to, and it will be little special because you made it yourself. think pre-umber is in canada around calgary. bought my sr from them and they were great to deal with. questions wouldnt freeze the beans personally. room temp in dark sealed bag is fine. roasting from frozen will mess with temperatures, most likely. mason jar is okay for de-gassing but so is ziplock bag or tupperware for couple of days. don't worry too much. bought some amazon coffee bags with degassing valve. cheap, and seal the beans in when cooled. first and second crack will become discernible. just roast few and listen. the cracks will start, and then get little more acti've go quiet, and then less than minute later might crack again write things down if it helps, or just trial and error. buy lb bag from torque in quebec who are great and have awesome stuff. by the ti'me you're fi've pounds into the first bag you will know what works. nothing will be ruined and it will all be fine, and trial and error will kick in. have fun!

crazy how one guy has managed to do this but an entire company of devs can't manage to add the shit people want. can't wait to buy the gane year from now when its dollars cheaper and has twice the amount of content from, not official devs, but the modding community. crazy that theres of these games, are they not seeing the failure of company like activision? wonder how kaiodenic feels about all this, being essentially, an unpaid developer for frontier.

makes me think of how steam can someti'mes... well downloading save file just gi'ves all the achievements. mean that game has... um did change the subject too far? but don't think have any game wish had achievements but don't... just saying don't want to get achievements unlocked if download save filecheatdo something that gi'ves the achievement

you made the right choice. had to put my boy down as well, his cancer was extremely fast acting in that only got about week with hi'm after knowing of it. he stopped eating and just wanted to go out in the backyard, so made the call to bring hi'm in. been just over year now and it still hurts to think about.

delete all your saved cards off the app so that the next ti'me you are tempted you have to take the extra step of re entering that info. then delete the app to add another step of difficulty. next read and watch all the stories about people tampering with door dash orders. think about how your door dash food order has probably been in someones dirty, smelly car soaking up fart fumes. think about how at least one of your deli'very dri'vers sat your order on the restaurants bathroom floor as they desecrated the toilet. think about how someone has probably opened your order and did whatever they wanted with it unbeknownst to you. the odds are high since you use it so much. think of all the possible scenarios of how your food has been tampered with and let yourself be thoroughly revolted and put off entirely

you can always have blow out vow renewal years down the road when you are in better place to enjoy it. you can promise your fianc that you will start now planning the biggest, best celebration for your three year or fi've year anni'versary. then go all out, just the way he wants to.

have uterine pain that flairs up when i'm stressed. it feels like need to push its really bad. went to my pri'mary and she wrote an order for an ultrasound. went to gyno to have that done and she was getting info from me and she had the gall to ask condescendingly do you think you just have to poop? poop would make me want to vaginally push? fuck off. btw still don't know

feel like the best explanation maybe stretching what pokemon defines as evolution idrk would be selecti've gene activation and deactivation like how clownfish change sexes or bacteria adapt to environmental resources by essentially turning on or off protein production of specific genes. this could be activated rapidly by exposure to the various stones or environments required to form the evelutions as some sort of massi've cell signaling change? considering some of the changes possible in say caterpillars to moths don't think its unfeasible for it to just be selecti've activation of genes dependent on environment but still all contained in single eve much as stem cells to body cells.
