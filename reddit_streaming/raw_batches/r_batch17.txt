personally wouldnt worry too much about shit getting expensi've. as dad of years whos been in your position, i've found the following is true with kid that small it will be miracle if you get to maps in weeks lol by two weeks in there are normally some massi've shifts in the meta as people figure out whats completely fucking broken this league and word gets around. you can't predict what that is and if it involves build enabling items for your build you're fucked. conversely, if its not your build, even if your build is pretty meta, youll find tons of people switching away from your build and selling their stuff by weeks into the league. prices for anything except the rarest uniques generally come down over ti'me. it actually gets easier to farm more currency later on because things like harvest have window where they're worth lot that hits couple of weeks in. so look at what is actually valuable if you do make it to endgame farming and focus on that. always make shitload of money getting up into red maps just from adding harvest everywhere. the old niko node that got nerfed was great for this too, resonator prices went up as people started crafting in earnest.

probably us centrism at play. we don't associate violence or gore with taboo in the same way we do the suggestion that someone might have nipple. maybe its because we associate work with like, factory and blue collar jobs, where you might get mai'med, but have comparati'vely lower likelihood of seeing someones junk.

one thing is funny you wanted her to support you after she giving birth to child. shouldnt it be exact opposite? also felt that all you want to fun like back quickly after childbirth. mean six months is too soon considering hormonal havoc that pregnancy does to someone. and also felt only she is parent and you are not that involved. is this the case? someone said in the comments that there is lot of me me me. even felt so.

for the democrat, the essence of fascism is that it openly uses illegal violence and abolishes democratic rights and freedoms. and it is precisely against this that they whine so pitifully. for us there is neither reason to whine, nor to be satisfied with such characterization. we have always denied that the class struggle could be refereed by an allegedly superior authority, like football match we have always maintained that the working class cannot conquer political power democratically, that even the most democratic constitution serves to protect the capitalist form of production, that democracy masks the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie even when it is not like it has done so often drowning the labor movement in blood. rejecting violence, invoking the legality of democracy, means renouncing the revolution from the outset! by contrast, we rejoice when the bourgeoisie throws off the velvet glove of democracy, openly shows the workers its iron fist and thus proves to them that there is no justice that stands above the classes that the law expresses nothing other than the balance of power of the classes. international communist party

think she actually knows that shes not perfect but has created this social i'mage as shield, even tho were clearly seeing through. and you're pointing very interesting thing as well when does mary has really been held accoutable for saying horrible things to the cast? since shes not responding in super herratic way like lisa, the cast seems to let it go because theres nothing to milk. it looks bit hypocretical
