might be obvious to some but if you do wind run it conserves momentum from sprint so you can keep sprinting and sliding. for example if you verse the flying ddo jetpack guys you can wind run back and forth by spamming ax and they can never shoot you. then you can keep running while sprinting their bullets don't hit. regular jumping whilst sprinting also does the same thing to conserve momentum for sprints.

li'ved in alabama for ti'me as someone with graduate degree from well known private institution that's also originally from very cosmopolitan area and has traveled internationally. also have spent ti'me in new orleans and have dri'ven through all states. alabama doesn't necessarily fit its stereotype. it has some mountainous terrain and lakes that are very beautiful, theres actually hiking, cli'mbing, mountain biking, etc there. birmingham has some nice areas, auburn is nice college town, mobile has some good history and the gulf coast has great fishing. huntsville has one of the highest educated per capita population of any city in the us because of all the rocket scientists. of the three would choose alabama, although lot of it is very rural, very poor, and very religious which was not my thing and won't personally be moving back there ever. mississippi is the real life version of alabamas stereotype. it has the distinction in being dead last of the states in number of statistical categories, my personal favorite being number of dentists. in all seriousness its actually sad that mississippi is so poor and we should be ashamed that as nation weve allowed it. its worse in parts than some third world countries i've been to. would not recommend. la is la lol. iykyk. theres nowhere else in the us like it, and no city anywhere in america like nola. probably the best food destination in the us outside new york i'mo, the biggest problem with la and nola specifically for me is the insanely high rate of violent cri'me. its down right dangerous. if it wasnt id choose nola over bama. georgia is superior to all three i'mo.

certain commission based jobs. people will literally work beside someone making half million year and suck at it make virtually nothing and call it scam. it does suck that you can make nothing for your ti'me and still be working hard but don't call it scam because you don't have that skill set.

unconvinced how is soldier to know the order he has been gi'ven is illegal everyone in his unit can all agree that its illegal, because they share political ideology but in the court system, it would be legal. so do you get pass for disobeying an order because of all your friends say the order youve been gi'ven is illegal?

and ifwhen the law is usurped? ifwhen the courts are complicit? think we are reaching closer to that every day. think its i'mportant to note that we havent reached the point upon which we call upon the radical example of our founding fathers. but its better to be prepared if such day ever comes. think its also i'mportant to remember that bunch of yokels, armed mostly with blunt objects, got very close to having their hands on the entirety of congress. in my opinion, think its incorrect to assume that something like this would play out on the regular streets of america. there may be skirmishes here and there, but it would be focused and direct. at least for success.
