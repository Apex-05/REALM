would urge caution going in with lbs. lbs with the vest certainly isnt nothing, but this is both tripling the weight and altering the load distribution. its what think many would consider pretty big jump. i'm not saying don't do it good rucking weight comes down to your current level of fitness, other prior weighted carry experience, body size, etc. if you are pretty big person, maybe this is manageable. however, perhaps consider for your first few rucks some shorter loops that you can repeat so you have chance to bail early if needed. in addition to the plates, like to carry small first aid kit and small pocket knife.

the filibuster is extremely easy to remove if majority is sufficiently committed to removing it. right, again, your argument is that because it is possible for republicans to overcome the democrats, then the democrats arent really blocking them. because it would be possible to destroy the obstacle. but that's ... not what it means to block something, right?

no. i'm an indian who pri'marily learnt english and malayalam, along with some very basic hindi. although can speak hindi and can read and write it, this is not the case with lot of people from kerala or the rest of south india. its not just tamilians. this is also the case with lot of my friends from north east india. the you're talking about are not nati've speakers but the ones who can speak hindi as first language. switzerland recognises french to be its official language although its spoken only by of the population. people shouldnt be forced to forget their mother tongue and forced to recognise language which is strange to them as their nati've language.

oh word so he doesn't actually pick the winner like you originally commented, but instead you moved the goal post and now its he picks the ti'me, which no one is arguing against. it actually makes lot of sense otherwise the richest of the rich will use millions of coins to get and resell the song within minutes. this also gi'ves more opportunity to ti'me zones on the other side of the world to get the epic.

looking at the older leagues than breach, we have few that are still in the game but are ok because they are basic, non intrusi've, like strongboxes or shrines. the next one that should be looked into if ggg want to i'mprove it and make sequel is harbinger. its outdated af.
