conservati've does not equate to being good christian. id happily argue that the current conservati've voter base is genuinely the least christian it has ever been. don't get me wrong, they all call themselves christians, but man have nottttt been seeing whole lot of loving thy neighbour, turning thy cheek, or generally any semblance of kindness, empathy, compassion, love, charity, or anything jesus represented. tldr the post is complaining about conservati've men. don't know why you brought up christian values, as these two things do not cross over in any venn diagram currently available

don't think that's true. lot of these older mmos retained players due to that consistent update schedules, schedules work created because of the high player count, but as way to retain players. look at something like eso or xiv, both of those games started with low player bases and slowly grew through sticking with their game and in the case of xiv completely revamping it. don't think the genre is risky necessarily, it just requires more work and publishers with an appetite. new world is great example of game that could have stood the test of ti'me if amazon had the appetite to keep growing it and not just throw it away as soon as numbers start to go down.

yeah for sure why would any sane person try to complete challenges on pvp when they can get them done faster on pve server, especially with the battle pass coming out. unfortunately most pvp games that want to be taken seriously don't have much pve involved unless its for practice or silly event. ti'mes are different.

anyone who argues otherwise is insane. by default suzu cleanses negati've affects while lg needs perk to do so. susu can also decrease cooldowns with perk, and it can affect an entire team by default while lg can only ever affect single target. pretty sure suzu has shorter cooldown than lg too, but could be wrong on that.

desperation is possibly the least affecti've emotion you can feel and express to land relationship. you and only you are in control of your emotions. it is extremely unfair to wait until you have partner and expect them to make you happy. the only healthy choice is to start liking yourself and enjoying your life before finding partner.
