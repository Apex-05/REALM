your argument is flawed. we don't can't bring in another superstar because we don't have the cap for it unless the owner decided to pay the luxury. what could be done, as others have mentioned, is use some end of rotation or mid rotation guys and picks to consolidate in position to bring in role player who has playoff experience. that's all assuming we wanted to compete this season. no need to do all that if we want to develop in-house but that hasnt been working out as weve been leapfrogged by okc

don't know because it was the first de that used when got into linux suse around during that ti'me you had to do the work to make it work. was able to do much on what could do on windows. then seeing how customizable it was kept me coming back. also, anyti'me tried any other de, would try to make it look like kde. so why not just use it outright.

its tough situation, because ticketmaster can't cancel all resale tickets that were bought in violation of their policy except ones that were resold to fans. scalpers broke the rules to buy those tickets and ticketmaster is being forced by the ftcs lawsuit to enforce its rules. it shouldve never happened in the first place and ticketmaster is terrible company for allowing it.

oom only gi'ves hit rerolls in combat patrol, not plus to wound. also not available strategic reserves! units don't actually have point values in combat patrol, so there is no functional way to assign strat reserves units towards the li'mit. some units still have deep strike, though. only those units are able to start the game in reserves. and while all core stratagems are available, some are useless. for example, have yet to see combat patrol datasheet that has not had the grenades keyword stripped from it. op, either get the official warhammer app and check the faction page for the combat patrol, or go here to download info including the core rules. fyi, think the core combat patrol document might even be towards the back of the space marine codex?
