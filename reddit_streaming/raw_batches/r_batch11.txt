when an object becomes massi've enough, gravity causes it to crush itself under its own weight into spherical shape. this is known as being in hydrostatic equilibrium. the smallest object in the solar system that has been confirmed to be in hydrostatic equilibrium is rhea, the second largest moon of saturn with diameter of km or miles. there are other smaller spherical objects that have been rounded by their own gravity, but they arent quite in hydrostatic equilibrium. the smallest of which is mi'mas, the seventh largest moon of saturn with diameter of only .km or miles. anything smaller is able to structurally support itself from within so can have pretty much any shape.

speaking as parent and gun owner just ask. hey, just wanted to check. do you have firearms, and if so, how do you keep them secured? ill happily tell anyone who asks how our guns are in safe, with locks, and the ammo locked separately, and all of it in room that's inaccessible to kids. don't mind answering that question at all, no responsible gun owner would. the worst response responsible gun owner is going to gi've is info dumping about the cool safety features on their safe. anyone who won't answer or gets pissy about answering isnt safe gun owner for kids to be around anyway, i'mho.

my wife and are in our s. recently she said that if she had to do it over again, she would have eaten some pussy in college. in our s, shes discovering she might like women. that being said, she told me that while she has thought about it, its fantasy that she doesn't want to make reality. were monogamous with one another. not from standpoint of ownership, but because we have entered into commitment with and for each other. i'm all for polygamous folks to do their thing. i'm all for people to engage in threesomes or swing if that's their thing, but it isnt for us.
