today was real dig deep and find something kind of performance. yes, we needed set-piece, but make no mistake, this is team that's addicted to winning and keeping clean sheet. if we have to shithouse our way to league title then so be it, but we need to take pleasure in these kinds of wins. crystal palace are no pushovers and they were very stubborn defensi'vely and we just beat them while giving no quarter of our own. theres lot to take from that. points at the top, clear of city and clear of li'verpool will do me nicely. we need to be on it against burnley for sure. brighton will be tough too, but have confidence that arteta will go more full-strength than people think.
