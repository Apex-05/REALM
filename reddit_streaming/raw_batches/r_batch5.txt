know that this is going to be the most absurd trust me bro thing youll read on this website and don't expect anyone to believe me but as someone who was once states witness in very large federal fraud case and in separate instance had to deal with the stern family in businesspolitical setting the stuff he is saying about texting an fbi agent and sterns behavior is likely more truthful than not.

dno, but in the boys it seemed like she had plan, but most of it happened because of the other, unrelated things and she kinda got credit without doing too much. in genv it seemed like she wanted godolkin to follow her plan, but when he decided to go his own path she just ruined it out of spite. which is sad, because it seemed like godolkin would actually be able to become strong enough to control homelander and we could see very interesting power struggle in the boys. while his plan had lot of holes, it was actually working much better than anticipated and if not for polarity release he would actually win. so far feel like the writers are trying too hard to show her very smart, but just don't feel it. but we can't deny that in the lore she is actually smart and her plans are amazing that's more of common writers problem where you can't be genius, but have to write one. and taking that in consideration, she is the biggest threat to homelander and unless he kills her as soon as possible she will become the main character and win by being the shady mastermind which is kinda against the general plot of the boys, where we have another team of the main characters who should come up with such plans. nothing against her, but so far she does too much for the story and di'minishes lot of the other character decisions.

on sidenote you know whats interesting? in the vlog where is talking about the couchfabric swatches, she demonstrates how having the current couch l-shaped interrupts the flow of the room which leads me to believe they rarely use the archway on the right side of the fireplace. maybe they only need to walk from the bedroom to the kitchen and back. shrug feel like closing that archway off could have helped at least little with the floorplan and choice of couch. at this point, the fireplace fiasco feels like another step to distract from the bookcases.

seveda je. samo ti bojo takoj fdvjevci zabili, to je nehumano. kje bo sodstvo pri nas to dovolilo. podpisali smo kretenski samomorilni evropski dokument temeljnih lovekovih pravicah. sodni sistem temelji na iluziji rehabilitacije. do kri'minalcov je treba bit souten. seveda nobenega ne zani'majo njihove rtve, njihovih pravicah in soutnosti do njih pa ne duha ne sluha.
