well you said yourself that it might not make profit, and demanding that band do something like that that takes so much ti'me and money and coordination because they theoretically have the money to pay for it would just be rude and entitled. brendon has family and stopped touring because his priorities are with his wife and child maybe he wants to put his money towards his kid and not youtube video?
