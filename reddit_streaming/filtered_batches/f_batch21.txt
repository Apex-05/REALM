sorry for you but those arent original Seiko parts, everything comes from a china. Its a cool build but if he advertised the watch as made from original Seiko parts Im pretty sure he lied to you
Proponuję tak - wschod slonca zawsze bedzie o 4.30, zachod zawsze o 21, codziennie zmieniamy godziny zeby sie do tego dostosować, czasem mamy doby po kilka godzin czasem po kilkanaście ale wszystkim wszystko pasuje
Its exactly the opposite of how a true Christian should act. Im so sorry youre feeling this pain. Its your fathers loss. But heartache is heartache-Im just so very sorry this is happening. Such a useless waste of love.
Not supporting golf here, I have a very George Carlin mindset about golf, and I dont have much insight into how they deal with other pests, but I know for ants most courses use a mixture of water and molasses to manage ants. The molasses encourages bacterial growth that eats ant larvae.

It sounds like opportunities might be pretty limited there, which sucks if so. If thats the case, I would not let anyone win, but if they hit more and more gas a 3 will, Im not here to work that hard so let them get tired and worn out. No need for me to. Do what you do well, but dont kill yourself to win, just work in a way that you feel good about the work youre doing, apart from results. Let them carry the burden of results. Its fickle and always wants more. Thats their lesson to learn. If its something you really want, just count the cost. What do I get, and what does it cost? Am I willing to pay? Usually the answer is no, but that allows you to really go all out when its truly a yes.
Went to the big orange bookstore in my city you-know-which and for the first time I saw a separate bookcase committed to manga! I was so surprised. Of course the collection was all over the place, with Greek and English volumes and with no consistency, but still a good thing!

Beacon Hill usually has them, either at the Carniceria or the spot across from MacPhersons Abarrotes El Oaxaqueño although I dont recall seeing any just yet. Ballard Market had some for 15bunch and I vaguely recall seeing fake ones at the Seattle center Dia de los Muertoa event.
Thats exactly my point. People who have all their diplomas in June or people who have already taken them will have grades 3-4 lower than people who didnt even have to take them. My solution is postpone the January diplomas by about 8 instructional days to allow for equal instruction between the two sectors, or reduce the weightings. 30 weighting is unfair for you, yes, but 0 and insane grade inflation is also unfair too.
If we just try to hustle and grind we end up like crabs in a bucket. This is a societal problem and it needs systemic solutions. We should be emulating the French, not building a faux American exceptionalism.
Thanks! There has to be something cheaper than 300 out there tho. Im also afraid of theft bc its an apartment parking garage. I feel like its only a matter of time before it gets stolen. So it would be better it was a cheaper item than 300
Personally I wouldnt worry too much about shit getting expensive. As a dad of 7 years whos been in your position, Ive found the following is true 1. With a kid that small it will be a miracle if you get to t16 maps in 8 weeks lol 2. By two weeks in there are normally some massive shifts in the meta as people figure out whats completely fucking broken this league and word gets around. You cant predict what that is and if it involves build enabling items for your build youre fucked. 3. Conversely, if its not your build, even if your build is pretty meta, youll find tons of people switching away from your build and selling their stuff by 2-3 weeks into the league. Prices for anything except the rarest uniques generally come down over time. 4. It actually gets easier to farm more currency later on because things like harvest have a window where theyre worth a lot that hits a couple of weeks in. So look at what is actually valuable if you do make it to endgame farming and focus on that. I always make a shitload of money getting up into red maps just from adding harvest everywhere. The old Niko node that got nerfed was great for this too, resonator prices went up as people started crafting in earnest.
