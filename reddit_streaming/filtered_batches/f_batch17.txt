If you feel that empathy is forced down your throat then you are the person the game is trying to highlight. Personally I thought it was a great opportunity given in a game to let players mature a little and think deeper about life. It is literally one of the few games I have ever seen that doesnt sugar coat it or hold the players hand to make sure they feel comfy and safe. I would love more games like this, that pushes the boundaries for the media and challenges the players and forces them to question their emotional reflexes.
Si estás en ese punto con muchas ganas pero pocos recursos, estás justo donde empiezan la mayoría de los buenos fundadores. Lo ideal es que no te enfoques primero en qué producto construir, sino en qué problema resolver. Observa tu entorno en la universidad, tu trabajo en la startup o tu vida diaria y detecta algo que la gente odie hacer o haga de manera ineficiente. Empieza pequeño, con algo que puedas prototipar tú mismo o validar con herramientas gratis como encuestas o mockups. Y si el dinero es limitado, piensa en modelos de negocio digitales o de servicio, que requieran más tiempo que capital. Por ejemplo, podrías usar plataformas de automatización como T-Bit, que te permite crear agentes de IA para vender y atender clientes automáticamente en WhatsApp e Instagram, sin saber programar ni gastar mucho. Empieza resolviendo un problema concreto y deja que las oportunidades se revelen en el proceso.
Every new grad thinks they suck at their job. If they dont, then they are usually overconfident and make more mistakes. I always feel like I suck at any new job for the first year. Give it at least a year and see how you feel
Sonoita. Youll be a GL-7 6 months after graduating the academy. I know plenty of 7s who love comfortably in the Tucson and Sahuarita area. Tucson is a great lost cost of living city so you can really pocket some money here. Sonoita has good work and Tucson Sector is pretty solid overall. Youll gain senority fairly quickly there as well. Also, seeing San Clemente on there is wild.
I understand the concept of proportions. My point is, they dont commit crimes more than the typical Brit per capita. And where they do, its not their ethnicity or religion that drives it. Its the fact that theyre men. Control for them being disproportionately men, and its at normal rates again
Even then, v2 is a bum, and sinister, another god, is still an enemy. Our status doesnt change at all, were still screwed. Well, at least we have parrying now
In a word Yes! And you wanna be careful. Their teeth are sharp. Be very cautious of any wild animal. Theyre built to protect themselves, and if they feel threatened even the most mild can maim or kill.
Please downvote me for this but oh I see how it is. Jen, Jan, and Andy all have the flu this season. Not a single peep. Pretty boy breaks his nose and it will get an entire package. Poor Elaine was a must talk about as that is serious. Pretty boy will be fine.
Definitely not suitable. But I could never afford this. Even if I could? I wouldnt get it. I want something smaller. Like a Minnie Winnie. Something like that is more than enough for me to travel the US Canada.
