At this stage, do what you can to help your CV stand out to secure an interview. If the AI picture helps you get the interview, do it. Use your face card, if you have one. Hopefully you impress during the interview and the company hires based on the value you bring to the work. The technology exists, so take advantage of it. You wouldnt handwrite or typewriter your resume, diba? Youd use the computer.

THANK YOU FOR THIS Youre amazing! I really appreciate your dissection of the match and helpful tips. And thank you for confirming my amazing end game save and for catching that I crawled over forward to try and save him from not being picked up!
Which grew out of the Podesta email hacking by a Russian military intelligence agency, and Wikileaks publishing those emails. This was after Trump said on tv Russia, if youre listening, I hope youre able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing, I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press. There was nothing in the emails about a human trafficking ring, but trolls and bots pushed a narrative that any reference to getting pizza or pasta was supposedly code for illegal activities.

Really wish Spen support added for cover screen as well. Having to quick write on front screen without opening phone is a convenient. If this makes the phone thicker than before, it is fine for me.
Booked a qantas flight for next year, and tried to cancel today and was told I could only get qantas credit. With re-issue fee of 110 and new fare to be equal or higher value. I wonder if anyone had similar expereience pls.
Not much you can do except try to limit them seeing each other. privacy screens have 'worked' for me in the past. I am currently dealing with this but the neighbors dogs are in and out, but when out the barking is bad. Of course mine go out after dark and will bark for hours at the stars, which does annoy me. If you are in a HOA area or have stricter local laws there might be something to help cause friction between you and the neighbors. But dogs bark and we just have to decide how much we let them be dogs.
I can confirm that OGS is some damn good food too. Best BBQ Ive had in the state. Dude is cool as hell. You will need to check his facebook page every week so see when he is open though. It changes every week.
If by upcoming we include the ones that are shipping soon, then the mammoth, Stegosaurus, Pachy, and Andrewsarchus. Im really excited for Acro, Spino, Cerato, Woolly Rhino, Kelenken, and especially Spicomellus.
Its a visual reference. Usually when I get my hair done I am asked to show them a photo if I want a specific cut or colour. Its a very common thing. If you feel like a 13 year old I think thats an issue about something else
Que lindo hablar paja, jaja. Darle toda su libertad a un partido político único, sin libertades individuales, delegando la planificación económica al Estado y quitarlas a las empresas privadas. Quién deberia ser el partido único de Costa Rica? El Frente Amplio, el PLN?
зависит от того с кем говорить. С друзьями что сами матерятся чё нет, с теми кто не хотят не надо. Крч кому не похуй на маты то без них, кому всё равно с матами иногда.
