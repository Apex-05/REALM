I know that this is going to be the most absurd trust me bro thing youll read on this website and I dont expect anyone to believe me but as someone who was once states witness in a very large federal fraud case and in a separate instance had to deal with the Stern family in a businesspolitical setting the stuff he is saying about texting an FBI agent and Sterns behavior is likely more truthful than not.

Dno, but in The Boys it seemed like she had a plan, but most of it happened because of the other, unrelated things and she kinda got credit without doing too much. In GenV it seemed like she wanted Godolkin to follow her plan, but when he decided to go his own path - she just ruined it out of spite. Which is sad, because it seemed like Godolkin would actually be able to become strong enough to control Homelander and we could see a very interesting power struggle in The Boys. While his plan had a lot of holes, it was actually working much better than i anticipated and if not for Polarity release - he would actually win. So far i feel like the writers are trying too hard to show her very smart, but i just dont feel it. But we cant deny that in the lore she is actually smart and her plans are amazing thats more of a common writers problem where you cant be a genius, but have to write one. And taking that in consideration, she is the biggest threat to Homelander and unless he kills her as soon as possible - she will become the main character and win by being the shady mastermind which is kinda against the general plot of The Boys, where we have another team of the main characters who should come up with such plans. Nothing against her, but so far she does too much for the story and diminishes a lot of the other character decisions.
Lmao this guys has these lies ready to post in seconds, many people have addressed what you said, the shares are not tradable in any public exchange like Robinhood, but seriously you respond in seconds with long responses. As if its your job to lower sentiment. Everything you say is just misleading
On a sidenote You know whats interesting? In the vlog where M is talking about the couchfabric swatches, she demonstrates how having the current couch L-shaped interrupts the flow of the room which leads me to believe they rarely use the archway on the right side of the fireplace. Maybe they only need to walk from the bedroom to the kitchen and back. shrug I feel like closing that archway off could have helped at least a little with the floorplan and choice of couch. At this point, the fireplace fiasco feels like another step to distract from the bookcases.
Any QD-OLED 49 MSI. If its 144hz, its the same gen QD-OLED panel as the one in the 144hz G9 OLED. If 240hz, same again. Rinse repeat for any brand QD-OLED. I cant remember the name of the MSI in question but its trivial to find.
Seveda je. Samo ti bojo takoj FDVjevci zabili, To JE NehUMaNO. Kje bo sodstvo pri nas to dovolilo. Podpisali smo kretenski samomorilni evropski dokument o temeljnih 훾lovekovih pravicah. Sodni sistem temelji na iluziji rehabilitacije. Do kriminalcov je treba bit so훾uten. Seveda nobenega ne zanimajo njihove 탑rtve, o njihovih pravicah in so훾utnosti do njih pa ne duha ne sluha.
Remember ang tricy dito hanggang gate lang so make sure yun pupuntahan mo iadvise mo ba sunduin ka sa gate or if walking distance ka lang to let them inform the guards na may expected visitors sila.
