Leave the 30-35 mins for April and beyond. 28 is perfectly fine, 7 per quarter. Thats not too much to ask for coaching wise. But with the with way Joel throws his body, I understand the minutes restriction and caution.
If we had a veteran as his backup I wouldnt give a shit. But we have a top 40 pick 26 yo rookie waiting, so I just wantk to see if he can be at least a bit better than Rattler.

Embarked Units Units embarked within a TRANSPORT do not count as being on the battlefield for any rules purposes. This means that, unless explicitly stated otherwise, embarked units cannot do anything e.g. shoot, fight, use abilities, etc.. Similarly, you cannot select an embarked unit as a target for any rules, including Stratagems.
Healthcare has always been expensive and getting them to pay up when you need them has always been close to impossible.

They cant because they dont work in the industry and have nothing to show. They dont have the experience to be talking about these things with the authority they do. Its just noise
