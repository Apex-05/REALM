Anyone who argues otherwise is insane. By default Suzu cleanses negative affects while LG needs a perk to do so. Susu can also decrease cooldowns with a perk, and it can affect an entire team by default while LG can only ever affect a single target. Pretty sure Suzu has a shorter cooldown than LG too, but I could be wrong on that.
Weve been in talks with some of the higher profile players in the Nuzlocke community, and their feedback has been a huge help when its come to designing the teams for a fair challenge.
What makes the bug happen anyways ? Because as far as I know its running perfectly on my 5060ti. I even deleted the intro video file to skip their 10 hours of intro. its 20 seconds but Im dramatic
Ah. Gotcha. That makes me sad. I just want them to live their lives. But some idiot is probably going to climb the tree or whatever. Anyway, hope you enjoyed your visit.
Well, shit they should. Its no fluke that either team is in this and to take game 3 to 18? Thats hanging with them big time. And fuck this ump! That was strike 2 not ball fucking 4

Desperation is possibly the least affective emotion you can feel and express to land a relationship. You and only you are in control of your emotions. It is extremely unfair to wait until you have a partner and expect them to make you happy. The only healthy choice is to start liking yourself and enjoying your life before finding a partner.

they didnt really allow him so much as they were unsatisfied with glyn johnss mixes, and the tapes just sat there for ages and no one knew what to do with them
Sorry, new player, kind of dumb, could you explain this a bit more? So for example in my Sweden game its like 1842 investment pool is like 14million, how does spending that work? Because Ive seen people saying if Im not building anything then private will do, but the investment pool never seems to go down even if I dont build anything. How do I make them build stuff and actually spend the investment pool?
As an Austrian, how is Hitler talked about in regard to this? Even though he is associated with Nazi Germany, he was Austrian as you know. Even here in the US, the average person doesnt know that.
I just want the offensive line to provide at least 1 second of protection for whoevers in the pocket at this point its getting to the point where that LEGENDARY running back is even getting swallowed up at the line if not behind it fuck the quotes and nods of confidence when the confidence is at a 57 point deficit
Im no professional, but my best guess is this happens when someone allows their own unique identity to stop existing within the relationship. When the relationship ends, theyre faced with not just the loss of the relationship, but the total loss of their identity. I dont know that people necessarily have the words to express this when it happens, but I would wager a large amount on guessing that this is the actual cause. You will obviously enmesh somewhat in every relationship. This is to be expected. But when you lose your entire sense of self within a relationship and then it ends, that loss is far greater than just losing someone you loved. You also lose who you are. This is why its extremely important to maintain your individual frame in addition to who you are within a relationship

I did part two of the third one by relying on Sylvie to cripple basically every add by destroying their legs, their weapon, or in the case of snipers and HMG users, one arm. I still only won at the last possible moment because a one armed Gumusiay managed to hit the boss in the body on a 37 chance and that and the last round of Link Attacks lowered his HP enough for Sylvie to snipe him. RNG be RNGing. The third one in general is just not very fun - You have to perform an exact sequence of actions with Rosa and just completely rush down the bosses to heal her. Puzzle levels in SRPGs are fine but it is pretty boring when the solutions are so heavily scripted.
