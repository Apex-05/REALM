oh word so he doesnt actually pick the winner like you originally commented, but instead you moved the goal post and now its he picks the time, which no one is arguing against. it actually makes a lot of sense otherwise the richest of the rich will use millions of coins to get and resell the song within 30 minutes. this also gives more opportunity to time zones on the other side of the world to get the epic.
Looking at the older leagues than Breach, we have a few that are still in the game but are ok because they are basic, non intrusive, like strongboxes or shrines. The next one that should be looked into if ggg want to improve it and make a sequel is Harbinger. Its outdated af.
I prefer hybrid, anyways, but theres a difference between going from 60k to 80k and going from 200k to 220k. The former, Id 100 take it without hesitation, the latter I would be more nuanced depending on what the new job offered and what I was trying to accomplish by making the switch.
Nu formule 1 kijken en jointjes roken en chips eten. Ik ben morgen ook vrij, dus ik kan het laat maken Verder wel leuk weekend. Vrijdag had ik mijn moeder uitgenodigd om te gaan lunchen.

Id personally take the cop to small claims court if you actually have all that evidence. Sue him for your wasted time taking off work, commuting to the court, etc. its only like 60 to file a claim, which youd just tack onto your lawsuit. You dont need a lawyer for small claims, so Id be petty and do it for wasting my time.

This is just demonstrably incorrect analysis and I presume you know that on an psycho-emotional level. Also, the IRS could have finished their 2008-2021 or 2021-2025 financial audits and brought charges if you really want to wade in semantics.
Its almost as wide as an Audi Q8 - which is why its classified as an SUV-Coupe Parking is a similar issue like with SUVs I had no issues with rear view camera and getting out of the car but i am 185 - 81kg and live in germany, we might have more bigger parking spaces then UK
That light blue cloth hood? Ive had that drop before and it is very good. This is my point stuff like this should be documented and Im surprised that an addon doesnt exist to track stuff like this.
