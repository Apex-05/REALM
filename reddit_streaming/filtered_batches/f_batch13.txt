Thank you for such an informative reply! Ill definitely have to take notes on some of the recipe stuff you wrote. In terms of purely time, how long would you estimate each portion takes every week grocery shopping, prepping ingredients, cooking, washing dishes, storing the food? Im actually surprised that none of your family makes what you eat because many of my friends and family usually eat home cooked stuff that a family member makes Idk if this is an asian thing or not. I actually used to eat my dads cooking which I didnt like, so he ended up not cooking anymore as much. Its really refreshing to hear that it doesnt always have to be a communal activity.

lol yes work remotely 160k salary but not a 50 bonus more like 35 depending on how well company does and was recently laid off a few weeks ago so currently unemployed AND husband is currently in government shit down works for the feds so he is not getting paid since October 1. So yeah. Thats fun. No income for either of us He was also WFH for the past decade until they hauled everyone back in office this year which makes zero sense for the type of work he does. SMH.

I dont bother waiting for a free upgrade anymore. Like yesterday, I just rolled my eyes and bought the upgrade. Kind of regretted it. The guy next to me was coughing and blowing his nose the entire time. Almost declined the drinks and the food because of that.
Commenting on New to Linux, which distro should i choose?... Im also new. I tried ubuntu, but I kept getting an error during installation, so I tried second option, fedora. Its working fine for me.
I love eyesight I have a 2015 Liberty Legacy outside of Australia Eyesight has been fantastic. It has helped me countless times. Today I am picking up another Subaru 2025 forester touring. The legacy is going to be my sons first car. All the safety features give me assurance for him. In fact on the weekend he just did a defensive driving course in the legacy. He had to disable the eyesight traction control and lan departure systems for the track and skid pan driving. He told me even with those off the car was so stable. The instructor commented how well the Subaru handles in emergency braking, high speed turns some small under steering. I have no concerns with the eyesight or CVT. You just need to be servicing the Subarus on time.
I also think Im going to make a wall of shame and put their name on it if theyre being too unhinged- but that might do the opposite effect and encourage the behavior death
When I played bg3 with the first time I had something like 5 other friends playing it and I swear to god when I talked them about it, it seemed like we were playing 5 different games, I still cant belive that this game was possible to make. Hands down my game of the decade for now
Ugh, do they even say in advance that they will bring their BF? Do you think that their BFs are insisting that they come? Do you have a BFhusband, and do these women know your status?
