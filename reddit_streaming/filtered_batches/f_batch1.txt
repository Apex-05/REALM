Your suffering is there profit. Im a business owner and I can tell you the mindset becomes thats what you cost the company. They get use to paying you that amount and they dont want to pay more. If you ask management to pay you 18k more they will never do it. Why? You cost them 64k a year. To them its practically set in stone. I wouldnt waste time with the discrimination route unless you have a stellar legal case. You know you deserve more so quietly find a new job that pays more and exit stage left. You owe them nothing.

I mean if you know a little about the details of his situation it seems pretty believable. The mob got involved in his incident which is what caused the FBI to stumble across him and what he was doing. Im sure he gave them every piece of information he possibly could. Its not implausible to think that the agents working his case are still there and they could still have contact.
My top left adult canine never came in. It rests just above the baby one and if I push on my gum line through my lip its very easy to feel.
I was hoping the manufacturer of such a breaker wouldve figured that out so I wouldnt have to. If I were to make one, it would be an overvoltage protection breaker that monitors the phase to neutral voltage of both phases, and trips if at least one of them passes a threshold.
I mean its just Yaldys reality with a happy coat of paint. Would you have accepted Yaldys reality if he added and everyone will smile and feel happy with their lives.?
