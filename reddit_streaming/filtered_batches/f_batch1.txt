I think it could be a marketing thing possibly also being second favourite to rugby dosent help. Ive been to a few games and it feels like its an Away game rather than home game due to lack of kiwi supporters witch can turn some people off
Obviously lol. RE has arguably been action horror since RE2. If you know what youre doin in that game its a whole ass action game. I replay the RE series every year. And do a randomizer run of 2 when ever I get bored and feel like I have nothing to play.
You have to do that for any radio if youre not buying BNF planes bind-and-fly, comes with a receiver The whole point of the multiprotocol module is to connect to BnFs, really.
Rosy Boas and Childrens pythons are great picks. Also Sand Boas and Hognoses. Though please get a pet that you really want, dont just choose a snake cause its labeled beginner! If you have any particular snake in mind assuming you can afford to care for it properly get that one even if its not beginner. Just be sure to do very thorough research!

Good point, if we were really seeing in 3 Dimensions, looking at a box and you would be able to at least see its backside. We see twice in 2D and the small difference in those 2 vantage point give a perception of 3D

I had a major tantrum last week tapering for a marathon HRV went to absolute shit, as did RHR, sleep quality, stress level, everything Garmin claims to measure. I felt depressed AF with no clear onsetting event, felt terrible race morning, then started running and felt great, hit massive PR. If youve done the work, itll very likely just come together.
Yeah Im not sure what they thought would happen when you give us long site lines and make every push to the objective force you out of cover. Blackwell fields is an absurd map that pushes against everything the current maps have built, it doesnt make any sense and lacks any identity beyond bring frustrating as fuck to play on.
Is hard to look back and understand how much of an impact something has when you become accustomed to the things they gave you. Like watching scfi from the 70s with video calls and plastic clothing. It blends in to what you know and isnt as special. Shakespeare wrote so many story premises that have been regurgitated as Netflix and Hallmark specials that it is making Shakespeare seem like another reductionist when you look back but he is the original.
Holyshit let this Nihilister is actually X character die and let characters be their own characters please. Do you think you look smart making crackpot theories that piss all over the established lore like this?

Cara, por mais incrível que pareça, já vi gente falando que eles só são bons até XY, o que pra mim é surreal porque eu acho Viva La Vida fodastico de bom. O Mylo Xyloto não é o álbum que eu mais curto, mas não é de tudo ruim, a arte e o conceito são incríveis. Ghost Stories é demais, eu sempre achei engraçado como ele foi lançado entre dois álbuns bem coloridos deles, o A Head Full of Dreams eu já não curti tanto, mas tem músicas boas. Pior que o Everyday Life eu até achei bacana, mas não é um álbum que dá vontade de ouvir, agora os dois últimos, meu Deus, não dá não kk Espero que eles ainda façam um álbum explorando mais a musicalidade deles, porque eles são fodas, já vi as lives da época dos primeiros álbuns, e cara, o som que eles tiravam era insano. Acredito que eles foram para esse lado comercial por própria decisão do Chris, ele mesmo já disse que eles não curtiam mais esse som deles, e que ele gosta mais de músicas para grandes estádios, mas acredito que deve ter tido dedo da gravadora deles no meio para eles lançarem um som mais perto de outras bandas pop que estavam explodindo na época. Fora que esses produtores que trabalharam nesses últimos álbuns deles são horríveis, não horríveis, mas são mais de música pop mesmo. Vamos ver, já vi em algum lugar que o Chris queria lançar um último álbum pegando mais a parte dos álbuns antigos deles, só esperando para saber.
