Gamefreak, Nintendo, the Pokémon Company have a complicated relationship to put it lightly. In general game development with large organizations can be quite obscure to whose at fault for what and whose hands are bound. Nintendo its affiliates seem to simultaneously get shit on too much whilst also have some of the shitty things done be defended when if pretty much any other company did it, people would be a lot more noticeably up in arms. In general the idolization or devaluation of individual people as symbols of everything goodbad with a gameproducerdevelopmentbrandwhatever, seems a bit out of hand. S
I hadnt eaten anything in about 2 days. I was prepping as much as I could and also just forgot to eat ngl so, I think it just is too low of a dose for me. It sucks because I was suggesting he dose me with at least 1.4 but, I can understand he probably was just already kinda out of it from the G and T and if anything crazy did happen, it definitely was not a prime time for him to pick up the pace if he needed to drive me to a hospital. I wish I had my own supply for G but, tbh, Im really glad Ive been able to keep myself at bay and Ive been abstaining from it for about 4 months since I first tried it so far and I have no desire to get any crystal myself personally! I def couldnt smoke or use Tina regularly because of the heart palpitations again, Im grateful to not be a fan of getting bitten by that kinda drug-bug, unlike how I used to slamsniff K like a total degen however, I really just want to experience what all the fuss is about since G and T seem to be long-standing celebrities in the bigayqueer-chem-sex-scene while I genuinely could care less about sex, I totally understand the appeal of feeling stimmed, a little dissociated, and also enjoying that tipsy-playful lightheartedness the combos often inspire in my soul. I am considering just meeting up sometime maybe next week of in a couple months idk how busy either of us are going to be but I know I cant be fucking around too hard since school is still kicking my ass rn I do appreciate your input and Im ngl, I was thinking of starting at 1.5 mL for this upcoming G-sesh since, I genuinely think it could just be that the batch is relatively lower in potency but also potentially a metabolizing factormaybe its because I have a little bit more fat on me although Im not overweight Ive started running 5ks 3-5 days a week again recently so, Im hoping maybe I can shed some more pounds stay off drinking any alcohol for a couple more months to help boost that metabolism. I plan to report here once Im able to meet up with him and try out a decently naughty dose and if youll still be here, Ill be glad to tell about the experience in all the nitty gritty details youre willing to sift your eyeballs through relieved I hope youre having a great day and I hope you have a good night anyways

First one is written in a more old school style, second one is written in a more modern style. Whats annoying about new avengers is it requires you to go read other books to understand the whole story, like House of M and Civil War.
Als het pleisterwerk los komt zat het niet vast, dat ligt niet aan jou. Als het nog nat was geweest was de verf gaan bladderen maar dat is niet het geval. Tik eens op de andere bijgewerkte plekken, klinken ze holler dan de rest van de wand of niet?
Derby teams' learn to skate courses are usually aimed at adults, theres probably not going to be any kids there, they will also train you up from how to skate forwards right up to how to hit people in stages as you become ready. You dont need to do prior training. I think you do need to know that at least in my country roller derby is majority middle aged women in their 40s who have children. Ive made some great friends in every league Ive been in that are way older than me, I started when I was 20. Youll definitely still make friends but dont get your hopes up too high for the same age bracket of women. Theyll probably be older than you. To get ready you can start buying gear if you want. But theyll have hire gear you can borrow. I think its a much smarter idea to attend training first, cycle through some of their hire gear on offer to get a idea of what you like, or even ask the more experienced players if you can try on their protective gear or skates.

Çünkü günün sonunda herşey bir ülkenin içindeki siyasi kapitalde bitiyor. Türkiyenin içinde yeterince taban desteği olsa Türkiye 30 yıl önce Kandile 1 milyon asker yığıp zaiyata kayıplara dış ilişkilerde çıkacak sorunlara bakmadan PKK lider kadrosunu bitirebilirdi. Ama bu iç veveya dış siyaseten siyasal olarak çok pahalı bir opsiyon olacağı için olmadı. 11 Eylül sonrası ABDde IŞİD gibi oluşumları bitirmek için veya İranı köşeye sıkıştırmak için başkanın siyasi kapitali var. Ama mesela İrana bir kara harekatı yapıp 20 yıl İranda kalmak üzere bir işgal planı için kapital yok, bunu yapan başkanın partisi hezimete uğrar.
But Hex... REALLY?! WHY HIM AND NOT HER? It just doesnt make any sense at all. Its like, Idk, why to redeem a certified evil sorcerer over his sympathetic niece?? I kind of liked Charm on the original series and AF wasnt bad, but it seems OV made my girl dirty because... ?!?!?!?!?!?!?!? o_o

Dont forget the hoa hell scape that is this state. Trying to find a house not in an hoa is nearly impossible. Builders thinking low 300k is affordable is a joke
