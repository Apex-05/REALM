Its easy no Islamisation, no replacement, no mass immigrations, no left-liberal globalist Woke cult, right-wing in charge, mass deportations, total border closures, total ban of Islam, demolition of mosques and shelters.
Might be obvious to some but if you do wind run it conserves momentum from a sprint so you can keep sprinting and sliding. For example if you verse the flying DDO jetpack guys you can wind run back and forth by spamming AX and they can never shoot you. Then you can keep running while sprinting their bullets dont hit. Regular jumping whilst sprinting also does the same thing to conserve momentum for sprints.
Lived in Alabama for a time as someone with a graduate degree from a well known private institution thats also originally from a very cosmopolitan area and has traveled internationally. Also have spent time in New Orleans and have driven through all 3 states. Alabama doesnt necessarily fit its stereotype. It has some mountainous terrain and lakes that are very beautiful, theres actually hiking, climbing, mountain biking, etc there. Birmingham has some nice areas, Auburn is a nice college town, Mobile has some good history and the gulf coast has great fishing. Huntsville has one of the highest educated per capita population of any city in the US because of all the rocket scientists. Of the three I would choose Alabama, although a lot of it is very rural, very poor, and VERY religious which was not my thing and I wont personally be moving back there ever. Mississippi is the real life version of Alabamas stereotype. It has the distinction in being dead last of the 50 states in a number of statistical categories, my personal favorite being number of dentists. In all seriousness its actually sad that Mississippi is so poor and we should be ashamed that as a nation weve allowed it. Its worse in parts than some third world countries Ive been to. Would not recommend. LA is LA lol. IYKYK. Theres nowhere else in the US like it, and no city anywhere in America like NoLa. Probably the best food destination in the US outside New York IMO, The biggest problem with LA and NoLa specifically for me is the insanely high rate of violent crime. Its down right dangerous. If it wasnt Id choose NoLa over Bama. Georgia is superior to all three IMO.
Certain commission based jobs. People will literally work beside someone making half a million a year and suck at it make virtually nothing and call it a scam. It does suck that you can make nothing for your time and still be working hard but dont call it a scam because you dont have that skill set.
I agree. Go for a walk or if its your jam, jog or run to get your body moving, the blood pumping and your brain distracted. Then youre ready to go home and finish binge watching season three of The Diplomat.
Youre so f hot man.I would just sit there and mow on your pAnd let you pee in my mouth then Id eat that a, nice and slow and eat it real good.And then Id f both holes
Unconvinced how is a soldier to know the order he has been given is illegal ? Everyone in his unit can all agree that its illegal, because they share a political ideology but in the court system, it would be legal. So do you get a pass for disobeying an order - because of all your friends say the order youve been given is illegal?
I tried to avoid posting it here. Since the app doesnt have any feedback system, I was left with no option other than posting it here and also the developer of this app is active in this sub.
And ifwhen the law is usurped? Ifwhen the courts are complicit? I think we are reaching closer to that every day. I think its important to note that we havent reached the point upon which we call upon the radical example of our founding fathers. But its better to be prepared if such a day ever comes. I think its also important to remember that a bunch of yokels, armed mostly with blunt objects, got very close to having their hands on the entirety of Congress. In my opinion, I think its incorrect to assume that something like this would play out on the regular streets of America. There may be skirmishes here and there, but it would be focused and direct. At least for success.
In the little town where I work the city blamed two local gas stations for a leak . One ended up closing and moving the other had their tanks replaced . Several years later they found a sewer leak ..oops
