Except when Epic buys games, forces cross play across all systems, and halves lobby counts for everybody so that they can make you play against people on PS4 in 2025 cough cough fall guys

I understand it is really frustrating, I dont agree with you that it is your fault. You hired a company that represented themselves as a professional carpet cleaning company. You are not a professional carpet cleaner so you hired someone with the necessary expertise. That was the right thing to do. The fact that they destroyed your rug was their fault, not yours. As a professional company, they should be responsible for correcting the damage or paying for a replacement. The reality is that no matter how much research we do on these companies, it is rare that I get that over the moon experience that some reviews describe and sometimes its the opposite. Im sure you did your research. The simple fact is that they represented themselves as a professional company and they did a terrible job, destroying your company. None and I mean none of that is your fault. If you havent already, I would press them to make it right.
Get one of those desiccant packs and throw it in. I got some good reuseable ones that change color when they need to have their anti-moisture water properties recharged in the oven.
They look very similar but they are actually very different in gameplay mechanics. I think TotK made a much better UI for everything. Increased the durability alongside with the amount of enemies and gave us better bosses. They all except one felt like different phases of the same bossfight in the first game. I dont know which one to pick chatgpt says TotK is better but the community keeps saying that BotW is better. Why do people hate TotK so much?
Your argument is flawed. We dont cant bring in another superstar because we dont have the cap for it unless the owner decided to pay the luxury. What could be done, as others have mentioned, is use some end of rotation or mid rotation guys and picks to consolidate in 1 position to bring in a role player who has playoff experience. Thats all assuming we wanted to compete this season. No need to do all that if we want to develop in-house but that hasnt been working out as weve been leapfrogged by okc
I dont know because it was the first DE that I used when I got into Linux SUSE 9 around 2003 - 2004. During that time you had to do the work to make it work. I was able to do much on what I could do on Windows. Then seeing how customizable it was kept me coming back. Also, anytime I tried any other DE, I would try to make it look like KDE. So why not just use it outright.

Id say build a spreadsheet with rows for expenses and columns high medium and low. That should give you a good range. If you arent sure youve captured all expense categories AI should be able to double check your list.

Yeah I think PSN KB will be huge in this league, ESPECIALLY with force Wall. But I wont be league launching this time, Im going to be no-lifing Arc Raiders instead.
Its a tough situation, because Ticketmaster cant cancel all resale tickets that were bought in violation of their policy except ones that were resold to fans. Scalpers broke the rules to buy those tickets and Ticketmaster is being forced by the FTCs lawsuit to enforce its rules. It shouldve never happened in the first place and Ticketmaster is a terrible company for allowing it.
