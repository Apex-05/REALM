The way hes going about this is messed up. This is clearly not a conversation. It seems like hes just diminishing you and not really listening. Its ok that you fucked up he shouldnt be treating you like this. Also, are you both young? I only ask because it sounds similar to a way a teenage couple might talk, and might shed some light on how hes reacting

Once again, same answer as a similar poll about abortion on this sub, its not awesome, nor is it bad. It is AMORAL. It is neither morally correct nor incorrect, it just simply is, and is sometimes required to save the mothers life.
Maye is way better in his second season than a lot of QBs who came before him. Josh Allen was still learning how to play QB at this point, hes way beyond that. Only Justin Herbert and Pat Mahomes looked this good this early.
Ive recently started building lore teams, you of course have your Knights of the Round Table crew, then all the Argonauts weve collected, finally expanding on Alexander the Greats army, all the Fairy Knights, the Shinsingumi, and even just gunslingers.
I believe the hinge is solid ..some people had issues with the slider tho, but it varies per person, due to head size, how much they stress the headbands, for my personal experience its the perfect fit.
Its not just the ligaments that are of concern. Its the location of the fracture. If it occured in the middle of the tibia the diaphysis it has a much better prognosis compared to a fracture that extends to the articular surface i.e. Pilon or bimalleolar fracture.
Im sorry but a strict carnivore diet is absolutely NOT known to cure gout. The exact opposite has been proven, as excess amounts of meat, especially red meats and organ meats, increase uric acid in the blood, which then forms crystals in the joints, commonly known as gout. Check your serum uric acid regularly and be suspicious of any joint complaints. Take care!
Well, yeah. My argument was taking bad operators on classes with broken ones to say that the class can be weak despite them, their argument was taking a broken operator on a class with plenty of bad ones to say the class cant be considered weak because of them. My point was also that the class hardly means anything for the power level. If they want to sell a character on a bad class theyll just put something into their kit that allows them to ignore the bad parts of the class entirely, or just have them not play like the class is supposed to at all i.e. Kaltsit and Reed Alter are medics. Being an Executor Specialist didnt save Crownslayer from being bad despite the class being inherently strong, just like being a Vanguard is not a guarantee a character will be good because Ines exists.
It pivots on the 45degree portion if hit and is supposed to twist back. Chan is so f it gets hit really hard you have a chance of it not getting plowed away.
I think Leclerc and Rusell could be successful. No I dont think they could beat Max but I certainly think they will be right behind him in the championship in that Red Bull.
According to this list which is only a small sample size of 126 stores or so, so its not entirely accurate the top 4 selling comics last month had Batman in the title. Batman is what brings in the money, so thats what theyre going to focus on.
In terms of aesthetic, MJ has its own unique look, and the only way to approximate that look is to either train your own LoRA Qwen, Flux or Chroma or find one that somebody has uploaded to civitai tensor. art, or various other similar model hosting sites. In terms of being creative, the best open weight one is probably Chroma, but it takes some effort to learn to prompt for it properly
This I can relate to, its not a deal breaker if they dont though. I just fear that if I get into a relationship going forward that I might feel alone if that makes sense. My Ex cheated and I didnt talk to her for over a year, she sent me a text asking how I was doing and I opened up about my issues with incontinence and she mentioned shed wear diapers along side me to make me feel comfortable if we had been together. Not that I want her back or anything but it felt nice knowing that she didnt look at me differently and if things had been different would have went that far to make me feel good. But being single and not knowing if I will meet another, if theyd accept me or at the least be understanding or if the result will be rejection.
I would also say in addition to November donations due to food stamps defunding, the after holiday months like Jan-March are usually have a lot of need because everyone stops donating after the new year. Just something to consider.
Yes I was wondering about the same thing - it is so frustrating when things arent anything close to deterministic or repeatable, it is like a whack a mole some days
