Iodized table salt seems to have a negative effect on me causing edema in my feet. So I have avoided iodized table salt. I do not have this effect with sea salt, Celtic, sea salt or pink Himalayan salt. Seems theres more to iodized table salt than theyre saying.

Definitely the boobs.. but for some reason every time I pause it, it always stops on the cock... but I promise I really want to look at those big juicy boobs
Its so silly. Its been for ages and anyone thats bought with less than 20 in the last decade knows the LMI difference on repayments is minimal. Just something else to blame.
No I get that, but its still not someone whos representative of the average American. He has been afforded opportunities most of us dont even think to dream of. And theres nothing wrong with that, but as leader of a country Id prefer someone whos at some point had to do the grind and didnt have a safety net to fall on and got there on their own. Wishful thinking, I know.
You are right. What we all saw on the border with our own eyes day after day was not what really happened. Alternative Fudge is the right name for you. Alternative Facts must have been taken.
The overuse of filler wordsphrases is something I cannot abide. I broke up with a woman who couldnt get through a sentence without using either 'like' or 'do you know what I mean'. It was constant.
Dolencu jaz vam zelim poguma da obracunate s to nagnusno bando, nasilje rodi nasilje in prav je tako, drzava vam zal ne bo pomagala, teli specialci ki bodo en teden pri vas bodo varovali cigane in ne vas. Dovolj je bilo, bolje umreti stoje kot ziveti na kolenih...
Ive only used the free tier, and I think its better than the local models Ive used with ST. That alone is making it my daily driver. This post has me really interested in FL now
The power to admit new states or to change state boundaries is already outlined in Article IV, Section 3, Clause 1 of the Constitution. In short, and for the purposes of how it relates to this discussion, there cant be any top-down redrawing of state lines like youre advocating for. Such boundary changes must be agreed upon locally by the state legislatures themselves and then approved by Congress. So go on and talk to people in either of the Dakotas, to use your example, and belittlingly explain to them how they are basically the same state and are wasting electoral resources, and that they really should go on and merge for the benefit of everybody else.
My best run is 78k with vlad. Have been trying to do an hparmor run with beefy rings to see what the scaling is like. I had 4 rings with 3k hp, maybe 1 or 2 syringes, and 1 shrine dmg upgrade and ended with before using juice boost 30.5x dmg. I think if I replaced the armor with dmg I wouldve lasted longer. I was surviving swarmed hits all the way up to 10 and then got one shot cry
They are afraid he will turn the base against them. They are putting their careers above the welfare of the country they took an oath to protect. They could take care of this problem but they might lose their seats and that isnt worth it for them

I honestly wouldnt expect to spend that much brand new. I can find ones just like it around the 700 mark but gold is ridiculously high right now so maybe someone will want it.
Not really, its like Umpires Call in cricket, where theres a certain grey area where whatever the umpire decides on the ground is the decision that we go ahead with. Outside of that grey area, the technology gets to decide the final decision. Works pretty well in that sport, at least... Yeah, some people moan about it when a decision doesnt go their way, but most people usually shrug and get on with it.
Scientifically seen, it should be started as soon as possible below age 2 since the medication is approved for that age. But yes that up to age 6 window is the best though it works very well in all ages. Its about the gaba switch and as you know that happens very early so trying to modulate that should also happen very early.
This is exactly the result of the failure of patriarchy to adequately run the show. Patriarchy failed miserably. I never said it would be pretty. Dont be angry at me for acknowledging the reality of it. Be mad at the system that has destroyed so much. Patriarchy has never been pretty. It has always been violent, and horrific, unjust, destructive, and rape filled. If there is a chance to save anything going forward, it will not be saved by patriarchal rule. If you want to quake and cry while others try to save what remains, you go on and cry then. It is tragic. Be in your feelings. Patriarchy was always going to fail miserably, and here we are. The best we can do is save what we can, and minimize suffering as we are able, and to plan for something better so these failures are not repeated.
its the phoenix wheel. before you ask, it wont even run. the schuylkill river heritage center aka the foundry has been working for YEARS to get it up. heres some info
