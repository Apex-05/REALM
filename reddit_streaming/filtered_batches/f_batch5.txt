Youd be far from the first Redditor who ignores actual experts in favor of what you feel like is the truth. At a minimum youd be the millionth at least.

Oh my god, same. I am eternally grateful I got to stay home with them as babies and toddlers, but it was also hard hard. Now I finally feel like its fun and balanced. People told me I would be bored but I truly have not experienced that for even a second.
1. Misty Knight would have been re introduced in the Mcu and would have been the female lead. 2. Keep leader as the main threat with the serpent society as his agents. 3. Longer runtime the pacing was too fast 4. Eli Bradley would have gotten his powers towards the end setting up his return in Young avengers 5. Have Zemo return in Hannibal lector type role giving Sam
That sounds awesome! Having a community that focuses on learning and solid analysis makes a huge difference. Ive seen a few groups like that, even RYOs community has that same vibe, with people openly sharing insights and helping each other grow long-term. Curious though, what kind of projects or topics does your group usually focus on?
Video is peak but make sure to get a good thumbnail, itd be a shame if a video like this doesnt do well soley because of a mediocore or bad thumbnail
Ich denke nicht, dass das Sprit war. Der Sprit bzw. dessen Dämpfe wären schneller verbrannt und hätten sicherlich gleich schlagartig ein größeres Feuer ergeben. Ich vermute mal, dass die Kunststoffunterbodenverkleidung in Flammen stand. Bei solchen Fahrzeugen ist ja nahezu der gesamte Unterboden verkleidet. Die schwarzen rußigen Flammen deuten zumindest eher auf sowas hin. Dann ist dieser geschmolzene Kunststoff auf die Straße getropft und das Fahrzeug wurde einige Meter nach vorn bewegt. So Kunststoffe beschleunigen solch einen Brand ganz gut. Die spätere Explosion war das Platzen des Reifens. Der Sprit war vermutlich erst am Brennen, als das Fahrzeug lichterloh in Flammen stand.
Hay que recordar que en su primera postulación se ganó a buena parte del movimiento estudiantil adhiriendose al movimiento yo soy 132 o algo así era, ese fue el primero en que acuso de fraude y que le robaron la presidencia, muchos de eso jóvenes continuaron apoyando a san amlo y para estas elecciones muchos de ellos ya tenían hijos con capacidad de voto, no dudes que fueron influenciados por sus padres para emitir su voto a favor del anciano, y si a eso le sumas que fue el voto del hartazgo, ahí el motivo que le dio la victoria al viejo
The way they phrased it is weird, so of course if they meant that then I am sorry, but its hard to tell in this day and age which one they meant.
Cheapest fix is Anaxa. Run AnaxaBronyaTribbiesustain. Dont pull his LC, you dont need it, get his event light cone from the shop. You dont really need DHPT LC either. I do think youre overestimating how much investment mono-rem needs though. I run E0S2 Castorice, E0S0 Hyacine, RMC, and E0S0 Evernight the S2 Castorice was a lucky double-pull. That team blasts through its side of every endgame mode, three-starred a knight, and one-starred AA Lygus. If you enjoy these characters they are at their strongest now, and will remain strong for a long time.
I was watching without the sound for that OT. Assume the Malkin goal was waved off for premature substitution? Thats the most generous interpretation of that rule if it was, haha. Silovs had barely left his crease when Malkin jumped on!
To be fair to history, France was trying to do that pretty much since Charlemagne through to the games end. Sometimes their focus swapped to the Lowlands or Italy, but Aragon was up there, it was just they were quite unsuccessful. The vassals in Southern France were typically unruly and not too unified with the crown, and having to push through the mountains in Iberia was a nightmare, particularly whenever the Basques decided to go guerrilla warfare on anyone.

All we need to do is pass our dna along successfully to survive as a species,so living long enough to give our offspring a good start is all thats required of any living thing
Im probably going to make people mad. People who are obese in the vast majority of cases are less likely to have respectable attributes to their personality. Lack of discipline, lack of drive, lack of self respect and more People shouldnt be treated as lesser than others for being weak but under no circumstances should they stay weakoverweight. Short of something that makes it literally impossible to make physical improvements on oneself keep in mind that such conditions are rare. Even an amputee can still be at a healthy body weight. there is no excuse to not be at least at a healthy weight. Im not saying people need to be capable of running a sub 6 minute mile, run 5 miles, or be able to deadlift 2X their body weight despite that actually being reasonably possible with a few years of training and little time investment overall but it is not unreasonable to ask the average able bodied person to be at a healthy weight, be able to run a mile, and be able to bend over and pick something slightly heavy. If someone cant achieve that then yes, they are less worthy of respect than someone who has done those things. Not to say unhealthy people havent done respectable things but on a pure baseline of that persons respectability in day to day life, a reasonably healthy person is more respectable than an unhealthy one. Also more healthy does not equal more respectability after a certain point. Id say after someone is simply just not obeseoverweight and can function normally then being any healthier than that is more a matter of respecting oneselfpersonal achievement and shouldnt mean that theyre worth more than someone else in some way. Though I would say they are more worthy of admiration if thats the right word for it.
Dr Elizabeth, very pregnant, amputated his legs during a mass casualty event. I cant recall her characters last name, but it was Alex Kingston who played the part. Im a fan.
