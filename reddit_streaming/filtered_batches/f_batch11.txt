I mean. Most of that isnt new. Its been years since I seriously played BDO, but aside from the battle pass all of that was in the game when I started...somewhere between 5-10 years ago.
I did try to read and I just couldnt get into it! I also am immediately turned off a book if theres even a hint at a love triangle so I went into it bias lol

Conservative does not equate to being a good Christian. Id happily argue that the current Conservative voter base is genuinely the least Christian it has ever been. Dont get me wrong, they all call themselves Christians, but man I have nott been seeing a whole lot of loving thy neighbour, turning thy cheek, or generally any semblance of kindness, empathy, compassion, love, charity, or anything Jesus represented. TLDR the post is complaining about conservative men. I dont know why you brought up Christian values, as these two things do not cross over in any venn diagram currently available
Voting against this prop just means that property taxes can be raised on us and used for less worthy causes. You have that backwards - voting against prop Q means the taxes cant be raised.
Theres a tall building next to where we live, when me my kid are trying to find our bearings we often say oh, yes theres the ugly building, this way. Some buildings you walk past you really do wonder wth went through the designers minds. I dont think the Walky Scorchie would be even in the top 10 on my ugly building list.
You can get a sharkbite piece for maybe 20 max that will fix this in seconds with no tool besides side cutters and a maybe a pexcutter if its that damaged. Its the pricy option that comes with no tools

I dont think thats true. A lot of these older MMOs retained players due to that consistent update schedules, schedules work created because of the high player count, but as a way to retain players. Look at something like eso or XIV, both of those games started with low player bases and slowly grew through sticking with their game and in the case of XIV completely revamping it. I dont think the genre is risky necessarily, it just requires more work and publishers with an appetite. New World is a great example of a game that could have stood the test of time if Amazon had the appetite to keep growing it and not just throw it away as soon as numbers start to go down.
And the huge push for 1st person POV books is telling imo Bingo. This is why more and more 3rd person POVs are being dismissed because you cant relate to 3rd person. You need to be in 1st persons head at all times.
depends. if Im just having a few fights in free mode, then I do try to be honourable and go for a good fight, target the limbs and such. if Im running the gauntlet, those willies can get a plancon speared straight through the neck
I really want to not believe that given how much love shields got in Wilds, but on the other hand, yeah sometimes it really does just feel like they have an add difficulty button for the title update superbosses and its only effect is to just invalidate guarding.
And trumps reality killed the show. Id be willing to bet that at one point a Veep writer suggested something similar to Rudys Four Season landscaping and the show runners said it was unrealistic and nobody is that stupid.
Yeah for sure why would any sane person try to complete challenges on pvp when they can get them done 10x faster on a pve server, especially with the battle pass coming out. Unfortunately most pvp games that want to be taken seriously dont have much pve involved unless its for practice or a silly event. Times are different.
I always recommend this Disc to people when they ask what looks good on the format. I love the way its shot and it is extremely immersive. Wonderful 4K Disc!
