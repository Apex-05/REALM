Ive met only one. Josef. He is a YouTuber and lived not far from me. So I encountered him in a local health center. He has Russian wife, so they moved from USA with all their children. On his YouTube he tells how much he is happy to live here.
Not every person who didnt like TLJ falls into this category. Not even close I woukd say. There are valid reasons to not like the film, and thats ok. However the vocal minority lost all their cedibility with the tantrum they threw over every little thing, and they way they did it. You know who you are. Those people should not be catered to. Its the worst thing they could possibly do.

I would urge caution going in with 45 lbs. 15 lbs with the vest certainly isnt nothing, but this is both tripling the weight and altering the load distribution. Its what I think many would consider a pretty big jump. Im not saying dont do it - a good rucking weight comes down to your current level of fitness, other prior weighted carry experience, body size, etc. If you are a pretty big person, maybe this is manageable. However, perhaps consider for your first few rucks some shorter loops that you can repeat so you have a chance to bail early if needed. In addition to the plates, I like to carry a small first aid kit and a small pocket knife.
The filibuster is extremely easy to remove if a majority is sufficiently committed to removing it. Right, again, your argument is that because it is possible for Republicans to overcome the Democrats, then the Democrats arent really blocking them. Because it would be possible to destroy the obstacle. But thats ... not what it means to block something, right?
No. Im an Indian who primarily learnt English and Malayalam, along with some very basic Hindi. Although I can speak Hindi and can read and write it, this is not the case with a lot of people from Kerala or the rest of South India. Its not just tamilians. This is also the case with a lot of my friends from North East India. The 43 youre talking about are not native speakers but the ones who can speak Hindi as a first language. Switzerland recognises French to be its official language although its spoken only by 22 of the population. People shouldnt be forced to forget their mother tongue and forced to recognise a language which is strange to them as their native language.

i think im an exception but i started 8 days ago on 50mg! And Im feeling amazing already The rumination and anxiety spiraling cycles fully disappeared by day 5. The first 2 days were pretty bad where i couldnt sleep more than an hour or two at a time and I had night sweats and was basically lying half dead and having mini panic attacks entire days. And like 3-4 it was already significantly improved but i still had random strong feelings of badness. And now ive been feeling normal
Im fully aware, Im fully aware that its a layered representation of the characters that are the sum of her. You cannot convince me out of a gut feeling that theres just something weird about it.
