I dont like her and this doesnt help. Much smaller creators are putting out way better statements with a stronger stance. This just screams I need to say something because all my peers did
Played an indie VN called Mobile Murder Mystery. Its short and sweet, and its themes regarding isolation resonated with me. Ive also been playing Digimon Story Time Stranger, Ive really been enjoying it. Im looking forward to seeing how the story develops.
I mean as a European Vances talks about us were also pretty odd to me besides being completely wrong on everything but hey. Thats life. Or, in that Context, Musks actions here. All very odd. Everything Republicans are doing is very odd to me.
I thought literally every single person who played Crystal Shards remembered her because of the ominous look she gives the camera at the end when you cant be bothered to get one of the more annoying crystals.
Same here, wifes iPhone, iPad and Mac calendars are empty! I tried everything, sync from icloud, restore turn offon the sync but still nothing. Why does this happen? Is there a way to open a ticket?
How is meat easier to access? instead of buying and eating 10 different veggies you can get the same nutritional benefit from 1 piece of steak Especially in a cost of living crisis? I switched from NY steak to a mix of NY steakporkground beefchicken. Its not hard unless you are literally homeless. Its also harder to store. Not true, you can get a quarter cow and its good in a freezer for 1 year If anything veggies rot faster than meat since you cant really freeze them as easily Nutrition isnt better, the body needs carbs and fiber, The body doesnt need carbs, its just that it converts carbs into energy faster than proteinfats. Fiber is there to allow you to shit easier. But otherwise steak and eggs are incredibly nutrient dense that you dont need much else besides the supplemental veggies for fiber and some fruit for taste. You keep ascertaining that less meat and veganism is the same, and a cult. Can you please clarify why that is? Do you know what a cult is? You dont see meat eaters advocating for eating less veggies, they just eat meat, lift weights and get jacked. All I see is vegan zealots propagating the false gospel of veganism and how holy they are because they love to chew grass. That, homie, is a cult.
The wasian sons usually end up inheriting the white dads bwc when they reach adulthood but a lot of white guys are scared and dont wanna take that risk and worried about them having a little Asian dick but most of the time thats not the case
Enjoying something that was made with no soul? Now thats embarassing. Each and every one of DVlopers games werent made by AI, and theyre great, but this update is dogshit
I feel like Claudio would make more of an ally for Bond, while Victor is Bond, maybe Hwoarang as a big mobster they fight on their way, and Steve well idk, maybe Bryan as the Antagonist? Or Dargunov
Im struggling with the exact same thing currently. If Im sober I start hitting my head and shaking it to try stop the thoughts but obviously that doesnt help. Im 19F too, lost weight, cant sleep, quite unwell. People always say to stop drinking but they dont understand what its actually like having a constant 247 bully in ur head
The lyrics are not the issue as much as how they are delivered, and also the beats have not aged as well as other albums from the mid90s. That being said, I respect Hov a lot for consistently dropping albums for 10yrs straight, with many of them being outright classics, and others hood classics
