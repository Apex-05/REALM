The last company I worked for was like this. Only about 12 people in the company and the boss was always saying Well Google does this and Google does that. I would get mad like.. how about we blaze our own path? We sell curtains!
i see a lot of people in public servers putting 8 brontos when hatching eggs. one time, i checked a guys garden with 8 brontos but when i checked their stats, he only needed the 3 brontos 11, 9, 10. i told him if he wanted to trade his brontos for my kois andostriches for more use of his pet slots, but i guess he took it as an offense, started trash talking me for no reason, and left lol.
I mean yes but we just barely found that out, and its just a theory. But even basic everyday shit like why do we yawn? Scientists have no clue, there is theories like were trying to cool our brain down which sounds dumb to me

Back in 2008, Putin couldnt legally run for a third term, so he had Medvedev take the presidency while he slid into the prime minister spot. Later, he pushed a change to make presidential terms six years instead of four. Then in 2020, he reset his own term limits, clearing the way to stay in power until 2036. His 2024 win with 87 of the vote? Most observers say that number is statistically impossible. Sounds like what Trump is trying to do, Russifying the US.

Impressive_Heron_316 originally posted Dating this guy who said at a point he enjoyed being nonchalantmysterious but didnt really say why. I find it annoying, I try to ask questions about his activitiesdays and hes pretty short and difficult to talk to. He seems very aware of it though which gives me the impression its an act to keep us from getting serious. Its literally only been a few weeks of talking and like two dates so I cant tell for sure yet but he also just threw the I dont like texting much. Which is also fine if thats really the case as I also hate texting but is he just trying to get sex? We were unable to have sex the first two dates so not sure if hes expecting on the third but with this behavior I dont even want to. Could it be possible hes nervous and inexperienced with dating and thinks this will win me over or is he likely a player that is using the act to show he only wants sex?

You can only wear the old uniform if you didnt have all the pieces for the new one, at this point it would have to be approved by a supervisor. There wasnt a time where you could wear a mix, either all old or all new. The only time Ive seen people with the old uniform in the last couple of months was for maternity
She has almost 30k subs on yt now. I am not active on twitch anymore. But she actively participates in so many MCCs and collaborated with large MCYTubers like Inthelittlewood or ldshadowlady
Well you said yourself that it might not make a profit, and demanding that a band do something like that that takes so much time and money and coordination because they theoretically have the money to pay for it would just be rude and entitled. Brendon has a family and stopped touring because his priorities are with his wife and child - maybe he wants to put his money towards his kid and not a youtube video?

Both are good people by heart we can see that in the show, but who is better we cant say that because ashnoor had a very safe and happy childhood and treated as a princess by her parents, she never learned to raise voice or may be cursing because she doesnt needed that in her life, her parents were there protecting her, when it comes to farhana she fought her way to reach this stage, when people fought their way through suppression they will pickup some bad things along the line like raising voice and cursing as an armour or weapons, we cant judge on that, we should judge on her intentions, she is genuinely a good hearted person.
I would argue the Sega and esp N64 are the odd ones here for a unique layout combined with more buttons than usual. At least they share the 6 right hand buttons but the Z trigger of N64 is very special. All others are well
They work hard, but not nearly as hard as we do. Its why we are the ones trusted to cut people open and they are the medicsnurseswhatever else. Not to mention they carry next to no responsibility compared to us.. I never said you dont matter..
oh no he bled one time in a professional fight where it was very competitive for the first round against another fighter whos punching him in the face, in the biggest test of his career so far. Yeah hes definitely quitting!!!1!!!
My cousin was on MAFS, I wont say who he was but we all told him he was crazy to go on it. He had a girlfriend of 3 months when he got the call he was going on. He told us he wanted to lift his profile because he had a business he needed to get promoted. He was trashed on MAFS, but it actually did lift his business profile. We thought his life would be over, but it had a positive impact on his business and when I say he was trashed, he was TRASHED!! So maybe the old adage any publicity is good publicity is true.
