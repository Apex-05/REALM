My hands do the exact opposite. When I get even a little bit cold, my hands and feet turn dark purple. It doesnt help that I have some sort of autonomic nervous system issue that causes issues with blood pressure regulation, but yeah.
I dont see how Lohrei gets into the next game. Obviously you dont want to keep him out for too long, but theres a big difference of Chara mentoring a young mcavoy And mcavoy mentoring a young Lohrei. Mcavoy wasnt a liability shift after shift.

For someone so over the top with micro managing things and claiming its for the kids benefitsafety he should know that coats arent supposed to be worn in car seats. Maybe you should point that out to him. Hahaha

Im not very knowledgeable as I just got my piggy from my boyfriends step brother recently they didnt want her and we are currently looking for a friend for her. Maybe a week in she was taking food from my hands and letting me pet her. She is currently very happy when my boyfriend comes home from work and same when Im working. She trusts us more each day. But when her old family came to say hello they have two kids 3 and 4 they just grabbed her and were so disrespectful with her screaming at her, grabbing her so hard she tried to get away, poking her hard and even smacking her with their little hands to the point I could see fear in my piggies eyes and their parents didnt care and all they said was girls be gentle. Guess what the kids didnt care. It physically hurt to watch and I couldnt say anything because I didnt want to come off as a terrible person and have his stepbrother get mad at me. But I should have since it was my home and the piggy is mine now not theirs Ive already told my boyfriend those children and his stepbrother are not allowed in my home ever again due to how they treated our guinea pig. They also broke some of my stuff after running around my apartment which ended up being extremely expensive to fix. But thats besides the point Ive had her for about 2 months now and as of yesterday I took her out of the cage with her in her house since she wont let me pick her up and laid her on my stomach and let her be. She came out and snuggled with me for about an hour. I honestly think it depends on the piggy and what kind of environment they came from. But mine doesnt let me initially let me pick her up but if I pick her up in the hut and move her she will let me hold her and pick her up. I honestly think it takes time and the piggies need to learn to trust their new parents. Sorry for it being so long. Just wanted to share my two months experience
1. Firestar. the OG Boy but given the time I was reading the books I related a lot to him in the first few books when he struggled to be accepted and the amount of time we spent with him and the emotional reactions of everyone around him just made it worse or better, I guess. 2. Bristlefrost. The fact we saw a main series POV character die from their perspective shocked me and the death itself..man. Rootsprings reaction to all of it just makes it all the more tragic. 3. Yellowfang and Silverstream. They were just so well done...I cried a few times reading these ones.
I had a 2nd gen 6 cylinder for many years before I got this. Compared to this 4th gen, that thing sucked ass at accelerating and getting up hills. Sure, the 4th gen might only be 4 cylinder but you can feel and hear the power so well. It goes from 0 to freeway speeds faster than anything Ive driven before and I have to constantly check because it gets so fast, so quickly, and Im speeding before I even know it

Bueno la verdad si suenas super pick me jajajaja, pero mas allá de eso, es lo mismo que cuando alguien te dice como puedo ser flaca bueno comiendo menos y haciendo ejercicio... en este caso, interactuando de apoco con hombres, por ejemplo por tu estilo podrias ir a conciertos o tocatas, yo en mi juventú hice varios amigos asi, la única manera es saliendo de la zona de confort y poco a poco ir rompiendo el miedo, algo que me ayudo bastante es el bumble, pero no en opcion buscar pareja si no en la opcion buscar amigos, conoci muchas chicas y chicos buena onda, con los cuales hacíamos juntas y asi de apoco fue creciendo mi círculo social. Por ultimo, siento que eres demasiado enrollada para ser tan joven, mi mamá siempre me decía no te darás ni cuenta cuando llegues a los 30 y asi mismo fue .. y te va pasar a ti también jaja, aprovecha tus 20, pásala bien, disfruta, webea harto! rompe el miedo y habla con hombres hasta pillar pololo que entiendo que es tu objetivo! tu forma de pensar me dejó la sensación como si fueras una adolescente inmadura, lo cual no creo para nada que lo seas! pero si o si, siento que debes cambiar el enfoque del como estas mirando la situación, deja de enrollarte sola, en vez de preocuparte tanto del asunto es mejor ocuparse si quieres cambiarlo
And in some restaurants, the more you report, the more you have to tip out to coworkers. But many restaurants have mandatory tip outs based on a percentage of sales rather than percentage of tips, partly because of potential underreporting. It lets servers cheat the government without cheating their coworkers. Note that for servers who make less than 25k a year in tip income in the US, the No Tax on Tips Act will eliminate the tax advantage for underreporting tips. Thats a fairly low bar, so a lot of full time servers will still want to underreport, but those with lower tip incomes might as well report all their tips for the few years the Act is scheduled to be in effect.

Love it love it love it!!! My only concern would be whether the wavy kind of texture of the tile would make it hard to clean, but at least in the tub youre probably not splashing soap all over the walls. Or maybe you are, I dont know your life!
No you sound like a child cause this thread was not even about that. It was just a fun little thread about what nice things they did for each other and some people had funny replies while some people answered the question. You decided to make it into stan wars. Geez, you like Lestat fine, other people like Louis, other people Claudia, etc. etc. People listed out nice things and you got extra upset cause people were Literally naming what they felt Louis did that was nice. People also listed nice things Lestat did.
Thats what i thought about too a couple of days ago, i didnt really think much of it, but now i would like to know if the guards would allow it
Actually yes! After 5PM Pacific the player count shoots up to about 500-600 on a weekday like today, same with zombies. Not sure about weekends yet. Can definitely find lobbies, though I understand some people have some trouble finding lobbies for some reason.

Признать или не признать можно только факт. Мнение и оценочное суждение признать или не признать нельзя, это лишено смысла. Никто не признает, что большинство за хуйло, потому что это не доказанный факт. А про боли в чужих жопах то исключительно твоя фантазия.
This sort of conversation never goes well. Almost our entire representative government at the highest levels including the commander in chief are people who are at least 5 years past retirement age, some of them 20 years past retirement age. Getting old people to give up power, independence, mobility... requires a downright herculean effort. Its too bad this at least 37 of the country doesnt vote like they care about the elderly and healthcare and are too busy celebrating civilians being killed over falsehoods of them transporting fentanyl
