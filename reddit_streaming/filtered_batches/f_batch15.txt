Speaking as a parent and gun owner Just ask. Hey, I just wanted to check. Do you have firearms, and if so, how do you keep them secured? Ill happily tell anyone who asks how our guns are in a safe, with locks, and the ammo locked separately, and all of it in a room thats inaccessible to kids. I dont mind answering that question at all, no responsible gun owner would. The worst response a responsible gun owner is going to give is info dumping about the cool safety features on their safe. Anyone who wont answer or gets pissy about answering isnt a safe gun owner for kids to be around anyway, imho.
My wife and I are in our 40s. Recently she said that if she had to do it over again, she would have eaten some pussy in college. In our 40s, shes discovering she might like women. That being said, she told me that while she has thought about it, its a fantasy that she doesnt want to make a reality. Were monogamous with one another. Not from a standpoint of ownership, but because we have entered into a commitment with and for each other. Im all for polygamous folks to do their thing. Im all for people to engage in threesomes or swing if thats their thing, but it isnt for us.
I think circles, done right, can work! But in my training, the example circles had like 5 students. Of course those went well that example school had the staff well, they did for a hot minute while their grant lasted.
Theyve both been around before mega evolutions, but Flygon has still gone longer without any special treatment due to simply existing longer. And I was talk about ORAS, for the record
I am on a new soap box with her parents. They deserve her obnoxious behavior. She is 30, still getting ready in her childhood bedroom, flinging sushi drips off the counter, making drunk tts after going out at 2 a.m. They are enabling this ridiculous behavior. It isnt like she has health issues, and theyre allowing her to stay to get back on her feet. Theyre quite literally condoning this behavior. Theyre doing her zero favors.
To be fair the fired persons art looks so good, wish he wouldnt have been fired, we couldve seen how good his art was disappointed Also, no need to call AI artists degenerates,unless theres a good reason, just be sure to point the right person and not generalize
What the fuck. Your party is deranged lol. One potion gives you advantage on all attack rolls for 1 day, one potion cures all diseases, conditions, and restores all missing hit points, and one potion causes a fully grown night hag to crawl out of your mangled body, killing you instantly. And theres no way to know which is which.
Its all in the eyes, Chico most sincere life quote from Scarface lol. But yes, having an extremely low vibrational frequency is what these entities look for. And hundreds of people invite them in. Something I could never understand. At the end of the day, they just see us as simple hostscontainers they can take over. I know David Icke has publicly spoken against these entities. But I think he is actually a spokesman for them. The reason I say this is because I saw him talking in that British bodybuilding champions podcast. I think his name is Eddy. Anyways, when David would speak while being filmed by this high definition camera. There would be certain times when David facial appearance would change. It wouldnt be obvious at all but I would be able to pick up on it. His eyes! And I swear to God, his right eye would look extremely reptile-like. Along with his some teeth that would look more sharpened than others. I couldnt believe it. I would be thinking to myself okay maybe its the camera angle. Maybe its his eyebrows in which with age droop down on the eye. Maybe its his blue eyes! The more Id look at him, the more I would see it. And this was not more than 2-3 years ago. So there wasnt any pixels on the screen. It couldnt get more high definition than that. I really hope I am wrong but you never know. Everybody knows that being hidden in plain sight is very effective.
I have! One of my favorites is a neck-through Aries 7. Its nearly identical to my DC, but the beveling of the DC is what makes it for me. Its largely aesthetic, but I feel that the lower body bevel is just a bit comfier for extended play times.
As a rule of thumb, I dont usually go more than one class above what the car started as. So a B I would put at Max of A and so on

Yes 07 added the highlight stick which added more moves, I mentioned how 08s weapons system perfected it. The problem with the game was the pursuit logic. It was a thing where once you saw how badly the angles played downfield there was no challenge in the game unless you ignored a significant portion of the playbook.
It really just comes down to whether someone shows serious consideration for others. There are thoughtless people trying to help, for sure, and there are a lot of people who seemingly.. are able to manage weed, so it makes sense that the clumsier kind of talk is able to proliferate in recovery circles. But theres also a lot of self-defensiveness overriding any desire to ensure that ones words actually serve others recovery.. and all the responsibility is on the heads of the weed-sober people to make sure the cali-sober people stay comfortable and validated, and not the other way around.
I dropped a book on my face and scratched my cornea. It was a hardback anthology and I was lying in bed reading. I managed to drop it so the corner hit directly in my eye. Had to go to a specialist. I was terrified Id get some kind of infection, because it was a library book and not exactly sterilized for eyes.
