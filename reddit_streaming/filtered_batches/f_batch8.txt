its to do with the meat being fresh compared to supermarket foods which are refigerated and days old. most of the meats they sell are the ones on display which could be left for hours and allow bacteria to grow which is why i want to find a source which have vacumm sealed fresh meat or just very high quality grass fed meat
Yeah at first I was too cheap to feed the deer in Nara, but shortly after I realised that I would never feed them, even if the feed was free. Id rather people watch others getting swamped by the animals instead joy
Mal got flashbacks here joy hes right tho. Personally the t shirt is just more casual and I like that vibe more. Lingerie is like a business suit, you know whats cumming around the corner
The blue states started it though. And the fact is that even so-called red states still have many many rinos in charge. You would feel differently if members of your immediate family became addicted to meth, heroin, or cocaine.
Cherry picking a few dumps is cool but the median house in todays dollars from 1955 would be worth around 255k this is taking the high estimate. The median cost of a house today is 400k plus.
I guess you and I have different views on it. Planning, like planning to be a stay-at-home mom is, to me, basically giving up on having any agency in your life. And if an adult has a whole room dedicated to playing video games... eh, thats a choice I guess.
Gracias pa! La manuela es uno de las cosas que ocupan mis días y aunque la dejo a veces vuelve. En parte por eso también le meto a full a repartir en Capi, para llegar y ni pensar en eso.

There is a lot of evidence that this happened, obviously written documentation of eyewitness testimony, which is the best youre gonna get as far as tangible proof that an event happened thousands of years ago. Then there is archaeological evidence that lines up with the Bible and its locations in the middle east, with mentions of factually historical figures like Caesar. The push to disprove the evidence of a resurrection actually happening makes me curious of the underlying reason. Even Christianitys harshest Atheist critics even agree that Jesus of Nazareth was a real person and after he died there were people that said they saw Jesus resurrected.

Yeah, I know how it works in theory, but Im at a loss for what is getting flagged in a ITIL related conversation. That is the very definition of dry business content... you cant make it safer if you tried, the whole thing is laced with safety valves, and careful wording.
Why havent we gotten a Red vs Blue style series in the Helldivers universe. My only thought is that Helldivers are just so expendable it doesnt make sense for them to last as long as Spartans.
Yeah. But its complicated. The army leadership were all members of the Islamic Brotherhood. However, they are not ideologically committed. Now there is a broad coalition supporting the army. From Islamists to communists to liberals to everyday people. The overwhelming majority of people support the army. Partially because of how the RSF behave in cities they control.
Youre taking a lot of what I said completely out of context, taking it personally, quoting things I literally didnt even say so I will not bother to reply except to say I wish you the best.
Why would space aliens suddenly invalidate religions? Theyve been incorporating and changing their beliefs for centuries, its not hard to imagine them saying God also created these aliens and weve gotta tell them about Jesus. It really wouldnt be a big deal to people that already gobble up lies and ask for seconds.
The show worked with real FBI agents in the past. It was never going to be critical of the FBI. They are good guys. Were supposed to root for them.
