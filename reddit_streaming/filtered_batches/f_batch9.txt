im in a very similar boat rn!!! ive been on adderall for probably 7 years now, no issues. was on vyvanse before that. got diagnosed w POTS in middle school and stimulants never had an effect on that. spring 2024 i switched to wellbutrin 150mg after being on citalopram for a while winter 2023 all of a sudden my tachycardia became severe and constant. this past summer it got bad enough that i got put on propranolol. the suspicion is my meds even though IT STARTED BEFORE I SWITCHED!! i swear you can have the facts in front of them and theyll still ignore them
Lmao idk if its the pic or the John wick comment but Im CRINE! I think this is one reason I didnt like it initially because huh? I did not see that for Laurie at all. She was always strong but its like she became this stud hardbody lady lol.
There is more to a tire than how long it lasts. How well a tire grips on pavement, off-road, or on snow and ice depends on the type of rubber used. Noise and comfort are also things that can be engineered into a tire. Two tires might last the same amount of miles, but one might stop 30 feet sooner on wet pavement. In many cases tires that have better grip wear out faster because they use a softer rubber compound to improve traction. Check online and look at the articles and reviews on the tirerack website.
Gee, if only there was something that couldve been done to have stronger border security. Oh yeah, that bill that Biden proposed, which was the strongest border bill ever proposed , that Trump told his people to shoot down so that it could be used as a wedge issue in the election. Trump and Co. have no intention of actually solving the border, which would require actual legislation be drafted and passed. The EO that Trump signed is a Band-Aid. I personally believe that if undocumented people have been productive community members who have not been arrested for any crimes should have a path to citizenship if theyve been here more than a couple years and set down roots. The Republican Party just wants all brown people out regardless of their immigration status or contributions to the community.
Youre literally just complaining, like all the losers, that you cant low skill fly by defenders anymore. Im sure you dont play in Elite because how could you actually think this patch made it so defendersmidfielders are incredibly faster than attackers at moving around in general? Thats just not true. You need to actually bring your players to the ball rather than speed dribbling and spamming through runs, sorry.

Im a massive fan of both but No Way would that work. he doesnt have any straight man qualities, the Taskmaster has to have a straight man side so the comedian contestants can bounce off him. Conan would have to be too restrained, he wouldnt be able to use most of what makes him valuable. The Taskmaster is a host, Conan cannot cede the stage as a host must do, he has to have a role in the bit, cant just let it happen.
Well you need to decide what you want. You cant have the best set and still want it as cheap as possible. Those things dont go together. Best bang for your buck? Sure. But best possible set and cheap? No such thing.
Red flag. I am not quite ready to step into the dating pool, but close and just learning, listening as this is going to be so different after 30 years of marriage. But I honestly would see it as a red flag. I want to have fun, I want to have companionship, I want to enjoy the company of someone else I am attracted to. I think need is for family, children and perhaps in serious established relationships, it becomes a thing. But it would be a turn off for me in a dating conversation. Need is a different kind of void to be filled and I honestly think anyone that needs someone else to be happy or whatever the goal is has to work out their own issues. I would worry about if it was the right fit for me and is also such a serious thing to discuss in the sense of dating.
Any Germans on CDF awake at night? I was watching American Dad when Klaus mentioned something called Sp√§tzle. I looked it up, and came across Chef John recipe. It looks really nice and simple to make. Maybe I should make it like literally right now at 315AM lmao Im on a cooking spree, despite the fact our fridge is full of Spaghetti and Bolognese that my grandma made Bulgur patties also grandma Steak meat leftovers from my aunt when we were over at her place A big pot of chicken soup that I made from whole chicken A big pot of about 1kg cooked white beans in tomato sauce that I made a small pot of buckwheat I also made today and the cookies I just baked do they count? Do I want to add more food into the refrigerator?

2 of my past references would always request to provide their reference verbally, and HRhiring team agreed. These individuals were my references for 2 different jobs at different departments and HR accommodated the verbal reference check. My references would have me communicate this and pass along their contact information, so that HRhiring team could schedule a call directly. This was also pre-Teams before you were obligated to stare at the person on the other line. Now with Teams, they could record the whole conversation, so its presumably even easier. Perhaps something to suggest. It really alleviates the burden for the other person.
