"Your suffering is there profit. Im a business owner and I can tell you the mindset becomes thats what you cost the company. They get use to paying you that amount and they dont want to pay more. If you ask management to pay you 18k more they will never do it. Why? You cost them 64k a year. To them its practically set in stone. I wouldnt waste time with the discrimination route unless you have a stellar legal case. You know you deserve more so quietly find a new job that pays more and exit stage left.

"For Kintetsu trains, the Limited Express seat fee is an extra charge on top of your base fare. From Osaka Namba to Shiroko, the seat fee is around 1,500 to 2,000 yen depending on the train and time of day as far as I remember. You need this ticket because all Limited Express seats are reserved. You can buy the Limited Express ticket at any Kintetsu station from a machine or ticket counter. Just tell the staff or select your departure and destination, date, and time. You can also book online through Kintetsus English website and pick up the ticket later. If youre using the Kintetsu Rail Pass, it covers the base fare, but you still have to pay the Limited Express seat fee separately. Once you arrive at Shiroko Station, you can take a short local bus or taxi to Suzuka Circuit.

"How is meat easier to access? instead of buying and eating 10 different veggies you can get the same nutritional benefit from 1 piece of steak Especially in a cost of living crisis?

Not true, you can get a quarter cow and its good in a freezer for 1 year If anything veggies rot faster than meat since you cant really freeze them as easily Nutrition isnt better, the body needs carbs and fiber, The body doesnt need carbs, its just that it converts carbs into energy faster than proteinfats. Fiber is there to allow you to shit easier. But otherwise steak and eggs are incredibly nutrient dense that you dont need much else besides the supplemental veggies for fiber and some fruit for taste. You keep ascertaining that less meat and veganism is the same, and a cult. Can you please clarify why that is? Do you know what a cult is?

"Personally I wouldnt worry too much about shit getting expensive. As a dad of 7 years whos been in your position, Ive found the following is true 1. With a kid that small it will be a miracle if you get to t16 maps in 8 weeks lol 2. By two weeks in there are normally some massive shifts in the meta as people figure out whats completely fucking broken this league and word gets around. You cant predict what that is and if it involves build enabling items for your build youre fucked. 3. Conversely, if its not your build, even if your build is pretty meta, youll find tons of people switching away from your build and selling their stuff by 2-3 weeks into the league. Prices for anything except the rarest uniques generally come down over time. 4. It actually gets easier to farm more currency later on because things like harvest have a window where theyre worth a lot that hits a couple of weeks in. So look at what is actually valuable if you do make it to endgame farming and focus on that. I always make a shitload of money getting up into red maps just from adding harvest everywhere. The old Niko node that got nerfed was great for this too, resonator prices went up as people started crafting in earnest.","anger","0.5094465017318726"

"For the democrat, the essence of fascism is that it openly uses illegal violence and abolishes democratic rights and freedoms. And it is precisely against this that they whine so pitifully. For us there is neither reason to whine, nor to be satisfied with such a characterization. We have always denied that the class struggle could be refereed by an allegedly superior authority, like a football match we have always maintained that the working class cannot conquer political power democratically, that even the most democratic constitution serves to protect the capitalist form of production, that democracy masks the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie even when it is not like it has done so often drowning the labor movement in blood. Rejecting violence, invoking the legality of democracy, means renouncing the revolution from the outset!

All the casings were x-ray tested before being retreaded, and we had the option to get our own casings back if we didnt mind the wait, or could exchange for ready to go recased tires in a core exchange system. With 22 tires on the truck trailer combo tri axle trailer there was significant savings in retreading, especially for the trailer since those tires are under less stress.

"Dno, but in The Boys it seemed like she had a plan, but most of it happened because of the other, unrelated things and she kinda got credit without doing too much. In GenV it seemed like she wanted Godolkin to follow her plan, but when he decided to go his own path - she just ruined it out of spite. Which is sad, because it seemed like Godolkin would actually be able to become strong enough to control Homelander and we could see a very interesting power struggle in The Boys. While his plan had a lot of holes, it was actually working much better than i anticipated and if not for Polarity release - he would actually win. So far i feel like the writers are trying too hard to show her very smart, but i just dont feel it. But we cant deny that in the lore she is actually smart and her plans are amazing thats more of a common writers problem where you cant be a genius, but have to write one. And taking that in consideration, she is the biggest threat to Homelander and unless he kills her as soon as possible - she will become the main character and win by being the shady mastermind which is kinda against the general plot of The Boys, where we have another team of the main characters who should come up with such plans. Nothing against her, but so far she does too much for the story and diminishes a lot of the other character decisions.","sadness","0.7765253782272339"

They broke u see pressure and now that same pressure will be applied to gun manufacturers everywhere. They found their loophole, and you best believe its not gonna stop there. They want to cater to Commiefornia, then I choose to take my business elsewhere. Again, all of this is just personal opinion and Im not out here saying that if your supporting Glock, your ignorant. This is me and my call. Just not something I can get behind. They already had bans in place for what models you could and couldnt own. So it would make more sense to stop selling to CA altogether, until someone brought forth a lawsuit to unravel everything and then pick up where you left off. I preface this with I do not care about Glock switches and all that other crap. Its the principle.","anger","0.6017795205116272"

"El podcast está altamente ficcionado y guionizado... a pesar de que lo vendan como true crimesuceso de no ficción lo que me parece feísimo Parece ser el post que dicen pero que no haya salido de la creatividad del programa es otra cosa... El post a fecha de hoy tiene no más de 75 días, que es justo lo que deberá llevar en marcha el proyecto... según la información que han dado los guionistasdirectores de contenido.","neutral","0.6070095300674438"
"even as a relative neophyte I took note of Thomasons play during that sequence. i thought it was significant that Scarr came on ahead of Coady for Brunt. Is Coady carrying a knock as well?","surprise","0.7457618713378906"
"Iny experience I felt that the earlier chapters were the best and made me feel like the manwha was a 1010 but as the story got closer towards the end , it started becoming more cliche and generic and the romantic ships never sailed either. The ending was literally all the strong people teaming up to defeat a mega villian marvel type shit in just one try which honestly felt so underwhelming considering the hype and buildup around the wrong building and the character deaths.","fear","0.3085457384586334"
"If you are cool with using a computer you can get an eDRUMin12 from Audiofront, a lemon t950 pro without a module from Alibaba for around 1100-1350 depending what all you get. The eDRUMin is designed to play with drum software primarily and is a good way to get really good performance out of a kit for cheaper than buying into the Roland ecosystem. To get really good latency on windows I suggest focusrite 4th gen audio interfaces as those fit you an affordable very low latency experience using a good asio driver. If you have a Mac that delivers that without any additional stuff.","neutral","0.9474712014198303"
