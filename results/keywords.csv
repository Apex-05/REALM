"how is meat easier to access? instead of buying and eating different veggies you can get the same nutritional benefit from piece of steak especially in cost of living crisis? switched from ny steak to mix of ny steakporkground beefchicken. its not hard unless you are literally homeless. its also harder to store. not true, you can get quarter cow and its good in freezer for year if anything veggies rot faster than meat since you can't really freeze them as easily nutrition isnt better, the body needs carbs and fiber, the body doesn't need carbs, its just that it converts carbs into energy faster than proteinfats. fiber is there to allow you to shit easier. but otherwise steak and eggs are incredibly nutrient dense that you don't need much else besides the supplemental veggies for fiber and some fruit for taste. you keep ascertaining that less meat and veganism is the same, and cult. can you please clarify why that is? do you know what cult is? you don't see meat eaters advocating for eating less veggies, they just eat meat, lift weights and get jacked. all see is vegan zealots propagating the false gospel of veganism and how holy they are because they love to chew grass. that, homie, is cult.","vegan zealots propagating incredibly nutrient dense eating different veggies ny steakporkground beefchicken body needs carbs need carbs supplemental veggies energy faster ny steak meat easier"
