"Your suffering is there profit. Im a business owner and I can tell you the mindset becomes thats what you cost the company. They get use to paying you that amount and they dont want to pay more. If you ask management to pay you 18k more they will never do it. Why? You cost them 64k a year. To them its practically set in stone. I wouldnt waste time with the discrimination route unless you have a stellar legal case. You know you deserve more so quietly find a new job that pays more and exit stage left.

"For Kintetsu trains, the Limited Express seat fee is an extra charge on top of your base fare. From Osaka Namba to Shiroko, the seat fee is around 1,500 to 2,000 yen depending on the train and time of day as far as I remember. You need this ticket because all Limited Express seats are reserved. You can buy the Limited Express ticket at any Kintetsu station from a machine or ticket counter. Just tell the staff or select your departure and destination, date, and time. You can also book online through Kintetsus English website and pick up the ticket later. If youre using the Kintetsu Rail Pass, it covers the base fare, but you still have to pay the Limited Express seat fee separately. Once you arrive at Shiroko Station, you can take a short local bus or taxi to Suzuka Circuit. Since its for the F1 weekend, trains will be crowded, so its smart to book the Limited Express seat in advance to guarantee a spot and a smooth trip.","neutral","0.8135703802108765"

"How is meat easier to access? instead of buying and eating 10 different veggies you can get the same nutritional benefit from 1 piece of steak Especially in a cost of living crisis? I switched from NY steak to a mix of NY steakporkground beefchicken. Its not hard unless you are literally homeless. Its also harder to store. Not true, you can get a quarter cow and its good in a freezer for 1 year If anything veggies rot faster than meat since you cant really freeze them as easily Nutrition isnt better, the body needs carbs and fiber, The body doesnt need carbs, its just that it converts carbs into energy faster than proteinfats. Fiber is there to allow you to shit easier. But otherwise steak and eggs are incredibly nutrient dense that you dont need much else besides the supplemental veggies for fiber and some fruit for taste. You keep ascertaining that less meat and veganism is the same, and a cult. Can you please clarify why that is? Do you know what a cult is? You dont see meat eaters advocating for eating less veggies, they just eat meat, lift weights and get jacked.

"Personally I wouldnt worry too much about shit getting expensive. As a dad of 7 years whos been in your position, Ive found the following is true 1. With a kid that small it will be a miracle if you get to t16 maps in 8 weeks lol 2. By two weeks in there are normally some massive shifts in the meta as people figure out whats completely fucking broken this league and word gets around. You cant predict what that is and if it involves build enabling items for your build youre fucked. 3. Conversely, if its not your build, even if your build is pretty meta, youll find tons of people switching away from your build and selling their stuff by 2-3 weeks into the league. Prices for anything except the rarest uniques generally come down over time. 4. It actually gets easier to farm more currency later on because things like harvest have a window where theyre worth a lot that hits a couple of weeks in. So look at what is actually valuable if you do make it to endgame farming and focus on that. I always make a shitload of money getting up into red maps just from adding harvest everywhere. The old Niko node that got nerfed was great for this too, resonator prices went up as people started crafting in earnest.","amusement","0.789197564125061"

"For the democrat, the essence of fascism is that it openly uses illegal violence and abolishes democratic rights and freedoms. And it is precisely against this that they whine so pitifully. For us there is neither reason to whine, nor to be satisfied with such a characterization. We have always denied that the class struggle could be refereed by an allegedly superior authority, like a football match we have always maintained that the working class cannot conquer political power democratically, that even the most democratic constitution serves to protect the capitalist form of production, that democracy masks the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie even when it is not like it has done so often drowning the labor movement in blood. Rejecting violence, invoking the legality of democracy, means renouncing the revolution from the outset! By contrast, we rejoice when the bourgeoisie throws off the velvet glove of democracy, openly shows the workers its iron fist and thus proves to them that there is no justice that stands above the classes that the law expresses nothing other than the balance of power of the classes. - International Communist Party","neutral","0.5644369125366211"

Ive made some great friends in every league Ive been in that are way older than me, I started when I was 20.

"The story goes on like this, he was Born in Amstetten, Lower Austria, on April 9, 1935, Josef Fritzl was found guilty of one of the most horrifying incidents of rape, false imprisonment, and incest in modern history. When Elisabeth was eleven years old in 1977, he started sexually abusing her. Under the guise of assisting with the installation of a door, Fritzl lured her into the basement of their family house in 1984. He then sedated her with an ether-soaked rag and locked her up in a soundproofed crypt he had covertly built over a number of years the ceiling was just 58'' had she and her kids had to endure that for 24 years with no natural light. He forced her to have seven children with him as he held her captive for 24 years, SAed her frequently, sometimes many times a day. The mental trauma she and her three kids undergroundhad was really bad till this day she cant seem to get over it.

"When I left Christianity, I found that despite being told all my life that people had a God-shaped hole that they needed to fill with Jesus, Id been trying to cram Jesus into a hole that didnt exist. But the difference in my case was that I left primarily because I didnt believe, rather than because I didnt like it although I certainly didnt see God as loving before the end. I wasnt looking for anything to fill a hole left by the lack of Christianity, because there was no hole. A lot of people, though, leave Christianity for other reasons than me and go out in search of something to give them the same feeling of purpose, community, hope, etc. that Christianity was supposed to give them. Many find other religions that fit them better. Is this the sort of situation youre in now? Are you seeking the things that Christianity failed to provide?","neutral","0.4281057119369507"
"You go on and just keep on making excuses for being selfish and making up straw-man arguments no one ever said.

I advocate for it because most people are capable of being good parents and having kids changes you for the better. We ve done this for literally thousands of years but now in this time of abundance its some how too hard. Like just stahp. The rest of us will do the hard work. We get it. Also saying procreating is a base level instinct as a minor achievement - is so disconnected and bizarre from being a base level healthy minded human that blows my mind.

This puts the acceptance rate closer to 93 rather than 1. Again, this is public record primarily because it is being used in ongoing litigation.

Can you identify with his situation and comment? Q2. The way i know him is that a mutual friend asked me to meet him and give him some guidance on how he can make a business he was starting successful. I spent a couple of hours with him and suggested he run things in a very differently than he planned. Gave him some advice about the best way to market hos business and ways to get around some barriers.

Im not pissed off or anything, I gladly gave him some advice free of charge no strings attached.

A once retreaded tore can be retreaded a second time for use on a trailer if the casing is still good. All the casings were x-ray tested before being retreaded, and we had the option to get our own casings back if we didnt mind the wait, or could exchange for ready to go recased tires in a core exchange system. With 22 tires on the truck trailer combo tri axle trailer there was significant savings in retreading, especially for the trailer since those tires are under less stress.

"Dno, but in The Boys it seemed like she had a plan, but most of it happened because of the other, unrelated things and she kinda got credit without doing too much. In GenV it seemed like she wanted Godolkin to follow her plan, but when he decided to go his own path - she just ruined it out of spite. Which is sad, because it seemed like Godolkin would actually be able to become strong enough to control Homelander and we could see a very interesting power struggle in The Boys. While his plan had a lot of holes, it was actually working much better than i anticipated and if not for Polarity release - he would actually win. So far i feel like the writers are trying too hard to show her very smart, but i just dont feel it. But we cant deny that in the lore she is actually smart and her plans are amazing thats more of a common writers problem where you cant be a genius, but have to write one. And taking that in consideration, she is the biggest threat to Homelander and unless he kills her as soon as possible - she will become the main character and win by being the shady mastermind which is kinda against the general plot of The Boys, where we have another team of the main characters who should come up with such plans. Nothing against her, but so far she does too much for the story and diminishes a lot of the other character decisions.","disappointment","0.34008878469467163"

"There is a lot of evidence that this happened, obviously written documentation of eyewitness testimony, which is the best youre gonna get as far as tangible proof that an event happened thousands of years ago. Then there is archaeological evidence that lines up with the Bible and its locations in the middle east, with mentions of factually historical figures like Caesar. The push to disprove the evidence of a resurrection actually happening makes me curious of the underlying reason. Even Christianitys harshest Atheist critics even agree that Jesus of Nazareth was a real person and after he died there were people that said they saw Jesus resurrected.","curiosity","0.7463445067405701"

"Ive been there, manual checks start to feel like a full-time job after a while. One thing that sped things up for me was sorting emails by domain first and running bulk checks grouped by company instead of random batches. Catch-all filters usually repeat by domain, so you can skip hundreds once you figure out how that companys setup behaves. I also built a quick Google Sheets script that pings validation APIs overnight so everythings ready by morning. If you ever need cleaner starting data, Ive seen companies like Techsalerator or Clearbit offer lists that are already verified which helps skip most of the grunt work.","neutral","0.7735756039619446"

"I absolutely agree with you my brother. Which is my gripe with Glock. With all the latest developments of FRTs for absolutely every platform, banning things that are readily convertible will become the norm. They broke u see pressure and now that same pressure will be applied to gun manufacturers everywhere. They found their loophole, and you best believe its not gonna stop there. They want to cater to Commiefornia, then I choose to take my business elsewhere. Again, all of this is just personal opinion and Im not out here saying that if your supporting Glock, your ignorant. This is me and my call. Just not something I can get behind. They already had bans in place for what models you could and couldnt own. So it would make more sense to stop selling to CA altogether, until someone brought forth a lawsuit to unravel everything and then pick up where you left off. I preface this with I do not care about Glock switches and all that other crap. Its the principle.","approval","0.8015885353088379"

"If you are cool with using a computer you can get an eDRUMin12 from Audiofront, a lemon t950 pro without a module from Alibaba for around 1100-1350 depending what all you get. The eDRUMin is designed to play with drum software primarily and is a good way to get really good performance out of a kit for cheaper than buying into the Roland ecosystem. To get really good latency on windows I suggest focusrite 4th gen audio interfaces as those fit you an affordable very low latency experience using a good asio driver.
