"The reality here is actually quite simple, Mike Johnson does not want to protect the Affordable Care Act, which 24 million Americans rely on. He and his party hate this law that enabled millions of Americans to get coverage. They do not believe in healthcare as a right. This is their way of destroying it from within, allowing it to become so expensive that no one can afford it anymore, making millions of Americans uninsured. Republicans do not need one single vote from democrats, they can amend the rules of the chamber to permit passage of funding bills with a 501 majority. Without ACA subsidies, the cost of health insurance varies significantly by individual circumstances, but premiums are projected to increase significantly in 2026 if enhanced subsidies expire. For example, an average annual premium for a subsidized enrollee could jump from about 888 in 2025 to an estimated 1,904 in 2026, a more than 114 increase. The Trump administration announced it would not tap into an existing 5 billion contingency fund to pay for SNAP benefits in November. Democrats called this a gross dereliction of...responsibilities and argued the administration was intentionally inflicting pain. Amid the federal standoff, some states, like Louisiana, planned to use state funds to backfill SNAP benefits, while others, like Tennessee refuse to do so. Its time for a nationwide general strike. Shut the entire economy down and force republicans to listen to reason and get off of their fat entitled asses and do something to help the American people.",anger,0.66410047

"They existed before books. You misconstrue. Let me be more clear The point of books is to preserve, objectify, standardize, and regulate language and education. Beginning with personal memoirs, recorded history of peoples, transactional records, etc. the existence of a book is for one to look back on later, or to share that knowledge with another in a regimented and coehisve way, at ones own pace. Im not saying movies, video games, and music cant do that, but that was not necessarily the intent of those things to begin with. And I would argue, that it is not the main intent of such things today. Maybe, 1000 years from now, all classroom learning will be done through audiovisual, and we will have contacts connected to our brains that just tell us what everything is and means. But until that point, books are essential for having standardized ways of speaking and teaching people. The purpose of the teacher is then to break it down, and say things in a way that everyone understands. But the books purpose is to define clearly and inarguably what the thing is. The less people read and educate themselves, the harder it is to communicate with people outside of their circle or set of circles. I would argue that the inverse is also true people who read way more than average tend to talk funny to the rest of us, but they understand others significantly better than the rest of us. And they can get cultured a lot quicker than the rest of us can get edumacated. Thats what I meant. Preservation of books is preservation of language, history, ideas, and knowledge at its heart. The rest of these mediums arent. They can be, and sometimes are, but not innately.",neutral,0.8761481
"It is from the official site, you cannot break it up, it is on a timer just like the real exam. In case you were not aware, there are 4 quarters in the exam. After you finish the first quarter you cannot go back to thoseonce you click to advance to the second, after the second quarter is your scheduled break which is effectively a lunchsnack break. Then 34 are like 12. If you take an optional break between sections 12 or 34, your timer continues. The weird thing in the mock exam is that you cannot review it once you submit, but you can check and see the correct answer during the exam. It leaves a weird dilemma of do I take this as a real exam and just look at the score printout? Or do I look at every answer to see if I was right?. I would suggest 99 being in the camp of taking it as a real exam, I just marked certain ones for review and Id look at those before advancing to be sure I understood what it was going for.

"Im not very knowledgeable as I just got my piggy from my boyfriends step brother recently they didnt want her and we are currently looking for a friend for her. Maybe a week in she was taking food from my hands and letting me pet her. She is currently very happy when my boyfriend comes home from work and same when Im working. She trusts us more each day. But when her old family came to say hello they have two kids 3 and 4 they just grabbed her and were so disrespectful with her screaming at her, grabbing her so hard she tried to get away, poking her hard and even smacking her with their little hands to the point I could see fear in my piggies eyes and their parents didnt care and all they said was girls be gentle. Guess what the kids didnt care. It physically hurt to watch and I couldnt say anything because I didnt want to come off as a terrible person and have his stepbrother get mad at me. But I should have since it was my home and the piggy is mine now not theirs Ive already told my boyfriend those children and his stepbrother are not allowed in my home ever again due to how they treated our guinea pig. They also broke some of my stuff after running around my apartment which ended up being extremely expensive to fix. But thats besides the point Ive had her for about 2 months now and as of yesterday I took her out of the cage with her in her house since she wont let me pick her up and laid her on my stomach and let her be. She came out and snuggled with me for about an hour. I honestly think it depends on the piggy and what kind of environment they came from. But mine doesnt let me initially let me pick her up but if I pick her up in the hut and move her she will let me hold her and pick her up. I honestly think it takes time and the piggies need to learn to trust their new parents. Sorry for it being so long. Just wanted to share my two months experience",neutral,0.34933802

"Im probably going to make people mad. People who are obese in the vast majority of cases are less likely to have respectable attributes to their personality. Lack of discipline, lack of drive, lack of self respect and more People shouldnt be treated as lesser than others for being weak but under no circumstances should they stay weakoverweight. Short of something that makes it literally impossible to make physical improvements on oneself keep in mind that such conditions are rare. Even an amputee can still be at a healthy body weight. there is no excuse to not be at least at a healthy weight. Im not saying people need to be capable of running a sub 6 minute mile, run 5 miles, or be able to deadlift 2X their body weight despite that actually being reasonably possible with a few years of training and little time investment overall but it is not unreasonable to ask the average able bodied person to be at a healthy weight, be able to run a mile, and be able to bend over and pick something slightly heavy. If someone cant achieve that then yes, they are less worthy of respect than someone who has done those things. Not to say unhealthy people havent done respectable things but on a pure baseline of that persons respectability in day to day life, a reasonably healthy person is more respectable than an unhealthy one. Also more healthy does not equal more respectability after a certain point.

BG3 Makes its impact very front loaded. its got a very simple story structure and its branches are twigs. Its a great game for the target audience of people new to crpgs. it even uses 5e the system for people whove never touched a ttrpg before and dont know better. while it has lots of flaws they come out near the end of the game and these people dont play a second time, so things like the lack of real build diversity, poor balance or the rather linear narrative arent important to them. Pathfinders very backloaded, it doesnt have flashy graphics and cinematics nor does it directly show you the story if you arent paying attention. its a game that grows in value with time and effort invested. something you wont find from reviewers. its more lopsided.

I dont think there will be a new ship. Getting rid of the Merry was to facilitate Franky joining the crew and them having a ship with a relationship to a crew member that was more established than Usopps tangential association to the Merry through Kaya who has had nothing to do with the story since before the Grand Line. The Merry was cool but it doesnt have the same layers of personality that the Sunny does. Or the capacity for development by carrying its own shipwright. They wont need another ship because Franky can just supe up the Sunny in any way they may need. This is further supported by the fact that it was specifically stated Sunnys keel was made out of nearly indestructible Adam Wood which was an implicit promise this ship is going to stick around forever and wont suffer the same fate as Merry.,neutral,0.9070097

"Im no professional, but my best guess is this happens when someone allows their own unique identity to stop existing within the relationship. When the relationship ends, theyre faced with not just the loss of the relationship, but the total loss of their identity. I dont know that people necessarily have the words to express this when it happens, but I would wager a large amount on guessing that this is the actual cause. You will obviously enmesh somewhat in every relationship. This is to be expected.

My dad is an alcoholic and his marriage ended with my mom because of this. I have a 2-year old as well as two incredible step-kids at home and I want to be better for them. I also want to get my body back, I was a D2 athlete turned bodybuilder and I feel like Ive lost it all in 12ish months by drinking excessively and not giving a shit. I used to care so much about my hobbies like reading, video games and movieTV show online reviews and analysis but now theyve taken a backseat to my drinking and I hate it. Just did the math and Im spending 40-50 a week just on drinks. Lets not forget about the god awful sleep which is making everything worse and more difficult. Im done and Im engraving it in stone here on Reddit. Heres to the future!!!",disgust,0.35814264

"I tried to keep playing the game. Just a few hours most of my issues dissapeared, but others more reasonable arrived. In the end, my conclusion that the game isnt great stays, though for different reasons. The plataforming is non-existant or, when its there, its just boring. The enemies are boring, regardless of how easy or hard theyre, they all feel really similar. Theres an excess of backtracking, mostly because the game refuses to tell you where to go because fuck you I guess. This adds absolutely unecessary time to the game and isnt fun to do - there isnt that much to explore in each area and, as I stated, the enemies are boring as hell. You either figure out where to go or read a guide, which shouldnt be necessary for the main plot. The story beats are soo bland at least at the start. I was interested when I started playing it, but 90 of it its the game trying to make his sister likable it fails, I dont care about her at all, or the protagonist being VERY edgy after giving some phylosophical speech about some subject. I dont mind gore or nude in games, but Nine Souls has it just because it wants to shock the player and not in a smart way. I dropped the game after the second boss fight. The boss had a cool design and and interesting premise, but the devs fucked up it up completely you just fight her two minions and wait for her to come revive them. Really? Thats it? Extremely easy and boring. Remember when I said the enemies are boring regardless of being easy or hard? Thats an example. And in the end the protagonist the protagonist uses her mind controlling colar on her, instead of just killing her, because...? Well idk, hes an asshole I guess ?. Thats funny because just a few hours ago he saved that human villagers from being captured. His morals are all over the place and only appears when the devs think its worth it. Thats dumb.

"Lived in Alabama for a time as someone with a graduate degree from a well known private institution thats also originally from a very cosmopolitan area and has traveled internationally. Also have spent time in New Orleans and have driven through all 3 states. Alabama doesnt necessarily fit its stereotype. It has some mountainous terrain and lakes that are very beautiful, theres actually hiking, climbing, mountain biking, etc there. Birmingham has some nice areas, Auburn is a nice college town, Mobile has some good history and the gulf coast has great fishing. Huntsville has one of the highest educated per capita population of any city in the US because of all the rocket scientists. Of the three I would choose Alabama, although a lot of it is very rural, very poor, and VERY religious which was not my thing and I wont personally be moving back there ever. Mississippi is the real life version of Alabamas stereotype. It has the distinction in being dead last of the 50 states in a number of statistical categories, my personal favorite being number of dentists. In all seriousness its actually sad that Mississippi is so poor and we should be ashamed that as a nation weve allowed it. Its worse in parts than some third world countries Ive been to. Would not recommend. LA is LA lol. IYKYK. Theres nowhere else in the US like it, and no city anywhere in America like NoLa. Probably the best food destination in the US outside New York IMO, The biggest problem with LA and NoLa specifically for me is the insanely high rate of violent crime. Its down right dangerous. If it wasnt Id choose NoLa over Bama. Georgia is superior to all three IMO.",sadness,0.725868
Certain commission based jobs. People will literally work beside someone making half a million a year and suck at it make virtually nothing and call it a scam. It does suck that you can make nothing for your time and still be working hard but dont call it a scam because you dont have that skill set.,disgust,0.68814886

"And ifwhen the law is usurped? Ifwhen the courts are complicit? I think we are reaching closer to that every day. I think its important to note that we havent reached the point upon which we call upon the radical example of our founding fathers. But its better to be prepared if such a day ever comes. I think its also important to remember that a bunch of yokels, armed mostly with blunt objects, got very close to having their hands on the entirety of Congress. In my opinion, I think its incorrect to assume that something like this would play out on the regular streets of America. There may be skirmishes here and there, but it would be focused and direct. At least for success.",neutral,0.6476113

"If you feel that empathy is forced down your throat then you are the person the game is trying to highlight. Personally I thought it was a great opportunity given in a game to let players mature a little and think deeper about life. It is literally one of the few games I have ever seen that doesnt sugar coat it or hold the players hand to make sure they feel comfy and safe. I would love more games like this, that pushes the boundaries for the media and challenges the players and forces them to question their emotional reflexes.",joy,0.6151253
"Si estás en ese punto con muchas ganas pero pocos recursos, estás justo donde empiezan la mayoría de los buenos fundadores. Lo ideal es que no te enfoques primero en qué producto construir, sino en qué problema resolver. Observa tu entorno en la universidad, tu trabajo en la startup o tu vida diaria y detecta algo que la gente odie hacer o haga de manera ineficiente. Empieza pequeño, con algo que puedas prototipar tú mismo o validar con herramientas gratis como encuestas o mockups. Y si el dinero es limitado, piensa en modelos de negocio digitales o de servicio, que requieran más tiempo que capital. Por ejemplo, podrías usar plataformas de automatización como T-Bit, que te permite crear agentes de IA para vender y atender clientes automáticamente en WhatsApp e Instagram, sin saber programar ni gastar mucho. Empieza resolviendo un problema concreto y deja que las oportunidades se revelen en el proceso.",neutral,0.8514677
