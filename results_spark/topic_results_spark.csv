"i'm not very knowledgeable as just got my piggy from my boyfriends step brother recently they didn't want her and we are currently looking for friend for her. maybe week in she was taking food from my hands and letting me pet her. she is currently very happy when my boyfriend comes home from work and same when i'm working. she trusts us more each day. but when her old family came to say hello they have two kids and they just grabbed her and were so disrespectful with her screaming at her, grabbing her so hard she tried to get away, poking her hard and even smacking her with their little hands to the point could see fear in my piggies eyes and their parents didn't care and all they said was girls be gentle. guess what the kids didn't care. it physically hurt to watch and couldnt say anything because didn't want to come off as terrible person and have his stepbrother get mad at me. but should have since it was my home and the piggy is mine now not theirs i've already told my boyfriend those children and his stepbrother are not allowed in my home ever again due to how they treated our guinea pig. they also broke some of my stuff after running around my apartment which ended up being extremely expensi've to fix. but that's besides the point i've had her for about months now and as of yesterday took her out of the cage with her in her house since she won't let me pick her up and laid her on my stomach and let her be. she came out and snuggled with me for about an hour. honestly think it depends on the piggy and what kind of environment they came from. but mine doesn't let me initially let me pick her up but if pick her up in the hut and move her she will let me hold her and pick her up. honestly think it takes ti'me and the piggies need to learn to trust their new parents. sorry for it being so long. just wanted to share my two months experience",0,0.5604307

"i'm probably going to make people mad. people who are obese in the vast majority of cases are less likely to have respectable attributes to their personality. lack of discipline, lack of dri've, lack of self respect and more people shouldnt be treated as lesser than others for being weak but under no circumstances should they stay weakoverweight. short of something that makes it literally i'mpossible to make physical i'mprovements on oneself keep in mind that such conditions are rare. even an amputee can still be at healthy body weight. there is no excuse to not be at least at healthy weight. i'm not saying people need to be capable of running sub minute mile, run miles, or be able to deadlift their body weight despite that actually being reasonably possible with few years of training and little ti'me investment overall but it is not unreasonable to ask the average able bodied person to be at healthy weight, be able to run mile, and be able to bend over and pick something slightly heavy. if someone can't achieve that then yes, they are less worthy of respect than someone who has done those things. not to say unhealthy people havent done respectable things but on pure baseline of that persons respectability in day to day life, reasonably healthy person is more respectable than an unhealthy one. also more healthy does not equal more respectability after certain point. id say after someone is si'mply just not obeseoverweight and can function normally then being any healthier than that is more matter of respecting oneselfpersonal achievement and shouldnt mean that they're worth more than someone else in some way. though would say they are more worthy of admiration if that's the right word for it.",0,0.5089666

"i'm no professional, but my best guess is this happens when someone allows their own unique identity to stop existing within the relationship. when the relationship ends, they're faced with not just the loss of the relationship, but the total loss of their identity. don't know that people necessarily have the words to express this when it happens, but would wager large amount on guessing that this is the actual cause. you will obviously enmesh somewhat in every relationship. this is to be expected. but when you lose your entire sense of self within relationship and then it ends, that loss is far greater than just losing someone you loved. you also lose who you are. this is why its extremely i'mportant to maintain your individual frame in addition to who you are within relationship",3,0.3669437

"they existed before books. you misconstrue. let me be more clear the point of books is to preserve, objectify, standardize, and regulate language and education. beginning with personal memoirs, recorded history of peoples, transactional records, etc. the existence of book is for one to look back on later, or to share that knowledge with another in regi'mented and coehisve way, at ones own pace. i'm not saying movies, video games, and music can't do that, but that was not necessarily the intent of those things to begin with. and would argue, that it is not the main intent of such things today. maybe, years from now, all classroom learning will be done through audiovisual, and we will have contacts connected to our brains that just tell us what everything is and means. but until that point, books are essential for having standardized ways of speaking and teaching people. the purpose of the teacher is then to break it down, and say things in way that everyone understands. but the books purpose is to define clearly and inarguably what the thing is. the less people read and educate themselves, the harder it is to communicate with people outside of their circle or set of circles. would argue that the inverse is also true people who read way more than average tend to talk funny to the rest of us, but they understand others significan'tly better than the rest of us. and they can get cultured lot quicker than the rest of us can get edumacated. that's what meant. preservation of books is preservation of language, history, ideas, and knowledge at its heart. the rest of these mediums arent. they can be, and someti'mes are, but not innately.",1,0.21612483
